hep-th/9109011	Critical Boundary Conditions for the Effective String	Gauge systems in the confining phase induce constraints at the boundaries of the effective string, which rule out the ordinary bosonic string even with short distance modifications. Allowing topological excitations, corresponding to winding around the colour flux tube, produces at the quantum level a universal free fermion string with a boundary phase nu=1/4. This coincides with a model proposed some time ago in order to fit Monte Carlo data of 3D and 4D Lattice gauge systems better. A universal value of the thickness of the colour flux tube is predicted.	0	4	2
hep-th/9111023	Representation of Quantum Algebras and q-Special Functions	The connection between q-analogs of special functions and representations of quantum algebras has been developed recently. It has led to advances in the theory of q-special functions that we here review.	0	3	2
hep-th/9111062	On the classification of quantum W-algebras	In this paper we consider the structure of general quantum W-algebras. We introduce the notions of deformability, positive-definiteness, and reductivity of a W-algebra. We show that one can associate a reductive finite Lie algebra to each reductive W-algebra. The finite Lie algebra is also endowed with a preferred $sl(2)$ subalgebra, which gives the conformal weights of the W-algebra. We extend this to cover W-algebras containing both bosonic and fermionic fields, and illustrate our ideas with the Poisson bracket algebras of generalised Drinfeld-Sokolov Hamiltonian systems. We then discuss the possibilities of classifying deformable W-algebras which fall outside this class in the context of automorphisms of Lie algebras. In conclusion we list the cases in which the W-algebra has no weight one fields, and further, those in which it has only one weight two field.	0	34	34
hep-th/9112037	From polymers to quantum gravity: triple-scaling in rectangular matrix models	Rectangular $N\times M$ matrix models can be solved in several qualitatively distinct large $N$ limits, since two independent parameters govern the size of the matrix. Regarded as models of random surfaces, these matrix models interpolate between branched polymer behaviour and two-dimensional quantum gravity. We solve such models in a `triple-scaling' regime in this paper, with $N$ and $M$ becoming large independently. A correspondence between phase transitions and singularities of mappings from ${\bf R}^2$ to ${\bf R}^2$ is indicated. At different critical points, the scaling behavior is determined by: i) two decoupled ordinary differential equations; ii) an ordinary differential equation and a finite difference equation; or iii) two coupled partial differential equations. The Painlev\'e II equation arises (in conjunction with a difference equation) at a point associated with branched polymers. For critical points described by partial differential equations, there are dual weak-coupling/strong-coupling expansions. It is conjectured that the new physics is related to microscopic topology fluctuations.	0	11	8
hep-lat/9201004	How to Put a Heavier Higgs on the Lattice	The cutoff dependence of the Scalar Sector of the Minimal Standard Model can result in an increase of the existing triviality bound estimates of the Higgs mass. We present a large $N$ calculation and some preliminary N=4 results that suggest that the increase can be as large as 30%, resulting to a bound of about 850 G eV.	0	3	3
math/9201262	Editors' remarks (on two complexity theory surveys in the Bulletin)	The authors discuss the role of controversy in mathematics as a preface to two opposing articles on computational complexity theory: "Some basic information on information-based complexity theory" by Beresford Parlett [math.NA/9201266] and "Perspectives on information-based complexity" by J. F. Traub and Henryk Wo\'zniakowski [math.NA/9201269].	0	0	0
hep-lat/9202004	Multicanonical Ensemble: A New Approach to Simulate First-order Phase Transitions	Relying on the recently proposed multicanonical algorithm, we present a numerical simulation of the first order phase transition in the 2d 10-state Potts model on lattices up to sizes $100\times100$. It is demonstrated that the new algorithm $lacks$ an exponentially fast increase of the tunneling time between metastable states as a function of the linear size $L$ of the system. Instead, the tunneling time diverges approximately proportional to $L^{2.65}$. Thus the computational effort as counted per degree of freedom for generating an independent configuration in the unstable region of the model rises proportional to $V^{2.3}$, where $V$ is the volume of the system. On our largest lattice we gain more than two orders of magnitude as compared to a standard heat bath algorithm. As a first physical application we report a high precision computation of the interfacial tension.	0	470	63
hep-th/9202010	Toward a Conformal Field Theory for the Quantum Hall Effect	An effective Hamiltonian for the study of the quantum Hall effect is proposed. This Hamiltonian, which includes a ``current-current" interaction has the form of a Hamiltonian for a conformal field theory in the large $N$ limit. An order parameter is constructed from which the Hamiltonian may be derived. This order parameter may be viewed as either a collective coordinate for a system of $N$ charged particles in a strong magnetic field; or as a field of spins associated with the cyclotron motion of these particles.	0	0	0
hep-th/9202063	A Loop Representation for the Quantum Maxwell Field	Quantization of the free Maxwell field in Minkowski space is carried out using a loop representation and shown to be equivalent to the standard Fock quantization. Because it is based on coherent state methods, this framework may be useful in quantum optics. It is also well-suited for the discussion of issues related to flux quantization in condensed matter physics. Our own motivation, however, came from a non-perturbative approach to quantum gravity. The concrete results obtained in this paper for the Maxwell field provide independent support for that approach. In addition, they offer some insight into the physical interpretation of the mathematical structures that play, within this approach, an essential role in the description of the quantum geometry at Planck scale.	0	14	3
hep-th/9202065	Algebraic Structures and Eigenstates for Integrable Collective Field Theories	Conditions for the construction of polynomial eigen--operators for the Hamiltonian of collective string field theories are explored. Such eigen--operators arise for only one monomial potential $v(x) = \mu x^2$ in the collective field theory. They form a $w_{\infty}$--algebra isomorphic to the algebra of vertex operators in 2d gravity. Polynomial potentials of orders only strictly larger or smaller than 2 have no non--zero--energy polynomial eigen--operators. This analysis leads us to consider a particular potential $v(x)= \mu x^2 + g/x^2$. A Lie algebra of polynomial eigen--operators is then constructed for this potential. It is a symmetric 2--index Lie algebra, also represented as a sub--algebra of $U (s\ell (2)).$	0	16	14
hep-ph/9203204	The quest for low-energy supersymmetry and the role of high-energy $e^+e^-$ colliders	The motivations for low-energy supersymmetry and the main features of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model are reviewed. Possible non-minimal models and the issue of gauge coupling unification are also discussed. Theoretical results relevant for supersymmetric particle searches at present and future accelerators are presented, with emphasis on the role of a proposed $\epem$ collider with $\sqrt{s} = 500 \gev$. In particular, recent results on radiative corrections to supersymmetric Higgs boson masses and couplings are summarized, and their implications for experimental searches are discussed in some detail.

hep-th/9203064	New Approach to Thermal Bethe Ansatz	We present a new approach to the calculation of thermodynamic functions for crossing-invariant models solvable by Bethe Ansatz. In the case of the XXZ Heisemberg chain we derive, for arbitrary values of the anysotropy, a {\bf single} non--linear integral equation from which the free energy can be exactly calculated. The high--temperature expansion follows in a sistematic and relatively simple way. For low temperatures we obtain the correct central charge and predict the analytic structure of the full expansion around $T=0$. Furthermore, we derive a single non-linear integral equation describing the finite--size ground--state energy of the Sine--Gordon quantum field theory. PACS: 05.30, 03.70. 75.10.5	0	15	15
hep-th/9204081	Signature Characters for the Virasoro Algebra	The number of ghost states at each energy level in a non-unitary conformal field theory is encoded in the signature characters of the relevant Virasoro algebra highest weight representations. We give expressions for these signature characters. These results complete Friedan-Qiu-Shenker's analysis of the Virasoro algebra's highest weight representations.	0	0	0

As the condition for the null vector decoupling, we derive the existence condition of the q-vertex operators ( the fusion rules ).	0	1	1

hep-th/9205057	New Methods of Integration in Matrix Models	We discuss a new method of integration over matrix variables based on a suitable gauge choice in which the angular variables decouple from the eigenvalues at least for a class of two-matrix models. The calculation of correlation functions involving angular variables is simple in this gauge. Where the method is applicable it also gives an extremely simple proof of the classical integration formula used to reduce multi-matrix models to an integral over the eigenvalues.	0	2	2
hep-lat/9206008	Fermion-Higgs model with Reduced Staggered Fermions	We introduce a lattice fermion-Higgs model with one component `reduced staggered' fermions. In order to use the fermion field as efficiently as possible we couple the two {\em staggered} flavors to the O(4) Higgs field leading to a model with only one SU(2) doublet in the scaling region. The number of fermions is doubled in a numerical investigation of the model with the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We present results for the phase diagram, particle masses and renormalized couplings on lattices ranging in size from $6^3 24$ to $16^3 24$.	0	18	18
hep-ph/9206242	$SU(3)\otimes U(1)$ Model for Electroweak Interactions	We consider a gauge model based on $SU(3)\otimes U(1)$ symmetry in which the lepton number is violated explicitly by charged scalar and gauge bosons, including a vector field with double electric charge. Although there exist in the literature several models based on a $SU(3)\otimes U(1)$ gauge symmetry, our model has a different representation content and a quite different new physics at an, in principle, arbitrary mass scale. This is possibly the simplest way to enlarge the gauge group $SU_L(2)\otimes U_Y(1)$ in order to have doubly charged gauge bosons, without losing the natural features of the standard electroweak model. The price we must pay is the introduction of exotic quarks, with electric charge $5/3$ and $-4/3$. A previous version of the model was considered several months ago concerning the possibility that in this kind of models neutrinoless double beta decay proceeds even for massless neutrinos and with scalar exchange instead of vector exchange. Our work is in press in Physical Review D.	0	517	506

math/9207202	Sequences of analytic disks	The subject considered in this paper has, at least, three points of interest. Suppose that we have a sequence of one-dimensional analytic varieties in a domain in $\Bbb C^n$. The cluster of this sequence consists from all points in the domains such that every neighbourhood of such points intersects with infinitely many different varieties. The first question is: what analytic properties does the cluster inherit from varieties? We give a sufficient criterion when the cluster contains an analytic disk, but it follows from examples of Stolzenberg and Wermer that, in general, clusters can contain no analytic disks. So we study algebras of continuous function on clusters, which can be approximated by holomorphic functions or polynomials, and show that this algebras possess some analytic properties in all but explicitly pathological and uninteresting cases. Secondly, we apply and results about clusters to polynomial hulls and maximal functions, finding remnants of analytic structures there too. And, finally, due to more and more frequent appearances of analytic disks as tools in complex analysis, it seems to be interesting to look at their sequences to establish terminology, basic notation and properties.	0	0	0
hep-th/9207038	Compensating Fields and Anomalies in Supergravity	We discuss the quantization of theories which are formulated using compensating fields. In particular, we discuss the relation between the components formulation and the superspace formulation of supergravity theories. The requirement that the compensating field can be eliminated at the quantum level gives rise to on-shell constraints on the operators of the theory. In some cases, the constraints turn out to be physically unacceptable. Using these considerations we show that new minimal supergravity is in general anomalous.	0	0	0
hep-lat/9207017	The equivalence of the SU(N) Yang Mills Theory with a Purely Fermionic Model	We investigate the detailed conditions under which a purely fermionic model with current-current interaction goes over to a renormalizable, asymptotically free SU$(N)$ gauge theory.	0	53	9
hep-th/9207097	The Large-$N$ Limit of the Two-Hermitian-matrix model by the hidden BRST method	This paper discusses the large N limit of the two-Hermitian-matrix model in zero dimensions, using the hidden BRST method.

hep-th/9208081	c = 1 Two Dimensional Quantum Gravity	The continuum (Liouville) approach to the two-dimensional (2-D) quantum gravity is reviewed with particular attention to the $c=1$ conformal matter coupling, and new results on a related problem of dilaton gravity are reported. After finding the physical states, we examine the procedure to compute correlation functions. The physical states in the relative cohomology show up as intermediate state poles of the correlation functions. The states in the absolute cohomology but not in the relative cohomology arise as auxiliary fields in string field theory. The Liouville approach is applied also to the quantum treatment of the dilaton gravity. The physical states are obtained from the BRST cohomology and correlation functions are computed in the dilaton gravity.	0	0	0
hep-lat/9209002	Critical Momenta of Lattice Chiral Fermions	We determine the critical momenta for chiral fermions in the domain wall model recently suggested by Kaplan. For a wide range of domain wall masses $m$ and Wilson couplings $r$ we explicitly exhibit the regions in momentum space where the fermions are chiral. We compare the critical momenta for the infinitely large system with those obtained on a finite lattice.	0	27	22
hep-th/9209048	Locality and Integration in Topological Field Theory	This paper is an expanded version of a talk given at the XIX International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Salamanca, July, 1992. We discuss the geometry of topological terms in classical actions, which by themselves form the actions of topological field theories. We first treat the Chern-Simons action directly. Then we explain how the geometry is best understood via integration of smooth Deligne cocycles. We conclude with some remarks about the corresponding quantum theories in 3 and 4 dimensions. This paper is written using AMSTeX 2.1, which can be obtained via ftp from the American Mathematical Society (instructions included).	0	5	3

We calculate total rates and rates with several kinematical cuts and confront the results with existing data.

hep-lat/9210002	4d Simplicial Quantum Gravity with a Non-Trivial Measure	We study 4d simplicial quantum gravity in the dynamical triangulation approach with a non-trivial class of measures. We find that the measure contribution plays an important role, influencing the phase diagram and the nature of the (possible) critical theory. We discuss how the lattice theory could be used to fix the quantum measure in a non-ambiguous way.	0	43	29
hep-ph/9210224	Dilatons in the topological soliton model for the hyperons	We show that the predicted hyperon masses in the topological soliton model are very sensitive to the value of the gluon condensate parameter that appears when the scale invariance and trace anomaly of QCD are taken into account by introduction of a dilaton field. This contrasts with the insensitivity of the soliton properties to the dilaton coupling. In order that the predicted strange and charmed hyperon spectra agree with the empirical ones the gluon condensate parameter has to be about (400 MeV)$^4$, which agrees with the result obtained from QCD sum rules. This implies that the bag formed by the scalar field must be very shallow.	0	1	0
hep-ph/9210255	Analytical on-shell QED results: 3-loop vacuum polarization, 4-loop beta-function and the muon anomaly	We present the results of analytical calculations of the 3-loop contributions to the asymptotic photon vacuum polarization function, in the on shell scheme, and of the 4-loop contributions to the on shell QED beta-function. These are used to evaluate various 4-loop and 5-loop contributions to the muon anomaly. Our analytical contributions to (g-2)_\mu differ significantly from previous numerical results. A very recent numerical re-evaluation of 4-loop muon-anomaly contributions has yielded results much closer to ours.	0	50	44

hep-th/9210161	Electron--Electron Bound States in QED$_{3}$	This paper is dedicated to the study of the existence and the properties of electron-electron bound states in QED$_3$. A detailed analysis of the infrared structure of the perturbative series of the theory is presented. We start by analyzing the two-point Green's function, in the Bloch-Nordsieck approximation. The theory appears to be plagued by severe infrared divergencies, which nevertheless disappear when vacuum-polarization effects are non-perturbatively taken into account. The dynamical induction of a Chern-Simons term is at the root of this mechanism. {}From the inspection of the electron-electron non-relativistic potential it then follows that equally charged fermions may either repel or attract and, moreover, that bound states do in fact exist in the theory. We calculate numerically the binding energies and average radius of the bound states. We find an accidental quasi-degeneracy of the ground state of the system, between the lowest-energy $l=-3$ and $l=-5$ states, which could be related to a radio-frequency resonance in high-$T_c$ superconductors.	0	0	0
hep-lat/9211023	Quantum-Gravity Path-Integrals on Simplicial Lattices	Euclidean quantum-gravity path-integrals are investigated within Regge calculus by computer simulations. The domain of integration is restricted by introducing a lower limit for the fatness of each simplex. We use the standard hypercubic triangulation of the 4-torus and irregularly triangulated lattices obtained by inserting a small number of vertices using barycentric subdivision. For limited fatness we find an entropy dominated phase with small negative curvature both for the regular and the irregular triangulation.	0	0	0
hep-th/9211060	On Macroscopic Energy Gap for $q$-Quantum Mechanical Systems	The q-deformed harmonic oscillator within the framework of the recently introduced Schwenk-Wess $q$-Heisenberg algebra is considered. It is shown, that for "physical" values $q\sim1$, the gap between the energy levels decreases with growing energy. Comparing with the other (real) $q$-deformations of the harmonic oscillator, where the gap instead increases, indicates that the formation of the macroscopic energy gap in the Schwenk-Wess $q$-Quantum Mechanics may be avoided.	0	0	0
hep-lat/9211047	The Loop-Cluster Algorithm for the Case of the 6 Vertex Model	We present the loop algorithm, a new type of cluster algorithm that we recently introduced for the F model. Using the framework of Kandel and Domany, we show how to GENERALIZE the algorithm to the arrow flip symmetric 6 vertex model. We propose the principle of least possible freezing as the guide to choosing the values of free parameters in the algorithm. Finally, we briefly discuss the application of our algorithm to simulations of quantum spin systems. In particular, all necessary information is provided for the simulation of spin $\half$ Heisenberg and $xxz$ models.	0	8	2
hep-ph/9212207	On the CP-odd Nucleon Potential	The CP-odd nucleon potential for different models of CP violation in the one meson exchange approximation is studied. It is shown that the main contribution is due to the $\pi$-meson exchange which leads to a simple one parameter CP-odd nucleon potential.	0	17	2
hep-th/9212057	CPT Violation in String-Modified Quantum Mechanics and the Neutral Kaon System	We show that $CPT$ is in general violated in a non-quantum-mechanical way in the effective low-energy theory derived from string theory, as a result of apparent world-sheet charge non-conservation induced by stringy monopoles corresponding to target-space black hole configurations. This modification of quantum mechanics does not violate energy conservation. The magnitude of this effective spontaneous violation of $CPT$ may not be be far from the present experimental sensitivity in the neutral kaon system. We demonstrate that our previously proposed stringy modifications to the quantum-mechanical description of the neutral kaon system violate $CPT$, although in a different way from that assumed in phenomenological analyses within conventional quantum mechanics. We constrain the novel $CPT$-violating parameters using available data on $K_L \rightarrow 2\pi$, $K_S \rightarrow 3\pi ^0$ and semileptonic $K_{L,S}$ decay asymmetries. We demonstrate that these data and an approximate treatment of interference effects in $K \rightarrow 2\pi $ decays are consistent with a {\it non-vanishing} amount of $CPT$ violation at a level accessible to a new round of experiments, and further data and/or analysis are required to exclude the extreme possibility that they dominate over $CP$ violation. Could non-quantum-field theoretical and non-quantum-mechanical $CPT$ violation usher in the long-awaited era of string phenomenology?}	0	43	13
nucl-th/9212014	Dynamics of antibaryon-baryon annihilation in the Skyrme model	We examine the dynamics of a baryon number zero lump in the Skyrme picture, as a model for annihilation in the $\bar{N}N$ system. We find that radiation propagates at the causal limit as a localized pulse and that the linearized theory gives a good approximation. Both of these results are contrary to findings in the Sine-Gordon model.	0	10	4
hep-th/9301097	Developing the Covariant Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to String Theory	We investigate the variation of the string field action under changes of the string field vertices giving rise to different decompositions of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. We establish that any such change in the string action arises from a field transformation canonical with respect to the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) antibracket, and find the explicit form of the generator of the infinitesimal transformations. Two theories using different decompositions of moduli space are shown to yield the same gauge fixed action upon use of different gauge fixing conditions. We also elaborate on recent work on the covariant BV formalism, and emphasize the necessity of a measure in the space of two dimensional field theories in order to extend a recent analysis of background independence to quantum string field theory.	0	39	36

Its topology at fixed $t$ is $S^1\times S^2$. This euclidean solution can be interpreted as a tunnelling to a hyperbolic space (baby universe) at $t=0$ or alternatively as a static wormhole that joins the two asymptotically flat spaces of a Reissner--Nordstr\"om type solution with $M=0$.	0	2	2
cond-mat/9302001	Comment on the Coupling of Zero Sound to the $J=1^-$ Modes of $^3$He-B	Features in the zero sound attenuation near the pair-breaking edge in superfluid $^3$He-B have been observed in large magnetic fields. Schopohl and Tewordt [{\sl J. Low Temp. Phys.} {\bf 57}, 601 (1984)] claim that the $J=1^-, M=\pm 1$ order-parameter collective modes couple to zero sound as a result of the distortion of the equilibrium order parameter by a magnetic field; they identify the new features with these modes. However, we show that, when the effect of gap distortion on the collective modes is properly taken into account, the collective mode equations of Schopohl and Tewordt yield no direct coupling of zero sound to the $J=1^-$ modes. Thus, the identification of the absorption features reported by Ling, Saunders and Dobbs [{\sl Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 59}, 461 (1987)] near the pair-breaking edge with the $J=1^-$ modes is not clearly established.	1	0	0

To allow efficient numerical calculations, an analytic approximation to the dispersion equations for photons and plasmons is developed. It is correct to order $\alpha$ in the classical, degenerate, and relativistic limits for all momenta $k$ and is correct at small $k$ for all temperatures and electron densities. Within the same approximations, concise expressions are derived for the transverse, longitudinal, and axial vector components of the neutrino emissivity.	0	108	64

In this paper we study the interaction between these dual strings. In particular, we consider scattering of two such strings in the limit where one string passes through the other string without touching it, and show that such a scattering leads to the exchange of a fixed amount of electric and magnetic charges between the two strings.	0	34	31

A random polytope is the convex hull $[x_1,...,x_n]$ of finitely many points chosen at random in K. $\Bbb E(K,n)$ is the expectation of the volume of a random polytope of n randomly chosen points. I. B\'ar\'any showed that we have for convex bodies with $C^3$ boundary and everywhere positive curvature $$ c(d)\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {vol_d(K)-\Bbb E(K,n)}{(\frac{vol_d(K)}{n})^{\frac{2}{d+1}}} =\int_{\partial K} \kappa(x)^{\frac{1}{d+1}}d\mu(x) $$ where $\kappa(x)$ denotes the Gau\ss-Kronecker curvature.

We used simultaneous optical shadowgraph, heat transport and local temperature measurements to determine the stability and characteristics of the azimuthally-periodic wall convection state. We also show that the second transition corresponds to the onset of bulk convection. Our results for critical Rayleigh numbers, precession frequencies and critical mode numbers agree well with theoretical results. The dynamics of the wall convection state can be described by a complex Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation.	0	0	0
hep-th/9303087	Extended Non-Abelian Gauge Symmetries in Classical WZNW Model	The present paper is revised copy of hep-th/9303087 in which higher spin extensions of the nonabelian gauge symmetries for the classical WZNW model are considered. Both linear and nonlinear realizations of the extended affine Kac-Moody algebra are obtained. A characteristic property of the WZNW model is that it admits a higher spin linear realization of the extended affine Kac-Moody algebra which is equivalent to the corresponding higher spin nonlinear realization of the same algebra. However, in both cases the higher spin currents do not form an invariant space with respect to their generating transformations. This makes it imposible for this symmetry to be gauged.	0	3	3
hep-th/9303142	On a possible algebra morphism of U$_q$[OSP(1/2N)] onto the deformed oscillator algebra W$_q$(N)	We formulate a conjecture, stating that the algebra of $n$ pairs of deformed Bose creation and annihilation operators is a factor-algebra of $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$, considered as a Hopf algebra, and prove it for $n=2$ case. To this end we show that for any value of $q$ $U_q[osp(1/4)]$ can be viewed as a superalgebra, freely generated by two pairs $B_1^\pm$, $B_2^\pm$ of deformed para-Bose operators. We write down all Hopf algebra relations, an analogue of the Cartan-Weyl basis, the "commutation" relations between the generators and a basis in $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ entirely in terms of $B_1^\pm$, $B_2^\pm$.	0	1	0
hep-ph/9303307	Flipped Angles and Phases: A Systematic Study	We discuss systematically the fermion mass and mixing matrices in a generic \linebreak field-theoretical flipped $SU(5)$ model, with particular applications to neutrino and baryon number-changing physics. We demonstrate that the different quark flavour branching ratios in proton decay are related to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angles, whereas the lepton flavour branching ratios are undetermined. The light neutrino mixing angles observable via oscillation effects are related to the heavy conjugate (right-handed) neutrino mass matrix, which also plays a key role in cosmological baryogenesis. The ratios of neutrino and charged lepton decay modes in baryon decay may also be related to neutrino oscillation parameters. Plausible Ans\"atze for the generation structure of coupling matrices motivate additional relations between physical observables, and yield a satisfactory baryon asymmetry.	0	33	28
chao-dyn/9303018	Non-ergodicity for C^1 Expanding Maps	In this paper, we consider the question of existence and uniqueness of absolutely continuous invariant measures for expanding $C^1$ maps of the circle. This is a question which arises naturally from results which are known in the case of expanding $C^k$ maps of the circle where $k\geq 2$, or even $C^{1+\epsilon}$ expanding maps of the circle. In these cases, it is known that there exists a unique absolutely continuous invariant probability measure by the so-called `Folklore Theorem'. It follows that this measure is ergodic. It has been shown however that for $C^1$ maps there need not be any such measure. However, this leaves the question of whether there can be more than one such measure for $C^1$ expanding maps of the circle. This is the subject of this paper, and in it, we show that there exists a $C^1$ expanding map of the circle which has more than one absolutely continuous invariant probability measure.	0	0	0
hep-ph/9304204	From Kaon-Nuclear Interactions to Kaon Condensation	An effective chiral Lagrangian in heavy-fermion formalism whose parameters are constrained by kaon-nucleon and kaon-nuclear interactions next to the leading order in chiral expansion is used to describe kaon condensation in dense ``neutron star" matter. The critical density is found to be robust with respect to the parameters of the chiral Lagrangian and comes out to be $\rho_c\sim (3 - 4)\rho_0$. Once kaon condensation sets in, the system is no longer composed of neutron matter but of nuclear matter. Possible consequences on stellar collapse with the formation of compact ``nuclear stars" or light-mass black holes are pointed out.	0	153	21
hep-th/9304055	Dilaton, Antisymmetric Tensor and Gauge Fields in String Effective Theories at the One--loop Level	We investigate the dependence of the gauge couplings on the dilaton field in string effective theories at the one--loop level. First we resolve the discrepancies between statements based on symmetry considerations and explicit calculations in string effective theories on this subject. A calculation of the relevant one--loop scattering amplitudes in string theory gives us further information and allows us to derive the exact form of the corresponding effective Lagrangian. In particular there is no dilaton dependent one--loop correction to the holomorphic $f$--function arising from massive string modes in the loop. In addition we address the coupling of the antisymmetric tensor field to the gauge bosons at one--loop. While the string S--matrix elements are not reproduced using the usual supersymmetric Lagrangian with the chiral superfield representation for the dilaton field, the analogue Lagrangian with the dilaton in a linear multiplet naturally gives the correct answer.	0	42	34

For the single layer system, considerable insight has been provided by a theory based on the fermion Chern-Simons picture, where the electrons are transformed into fermions that carry two flux quanta of a Chern-Simons gauge field. A similar picture can be used to characterize ground states which have been proposed for the two layer system.	1	0	0
hep-th/9305114	Fermionic Character Sums and the Corner Transfer Matrix	We present a ``natural finitization'' of the fermionic q-series (certain generalizations of the Rogers-Ramanujan sums) which were recently conjectured to be equal to Virasoro characters of the unitary minimal conformal field theory (CFT) M(p,p+1). Within the quasi-particle interpretation of the fermionic q-series this finitization amounts to introducing an ultraviolet cutoff, which -- contrary to a lattice spacing -- does not modify the linear dispersion relation. The resulting polynomials are conjectured (proven, for p=3,4) to be equal to corner transfer matrix (CTM) sums which arise in the computation of order parameters in regime III of the r=p+1 RSOS model of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. Following Schur's proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, these authors have shown that the infinite-lattice limit of the CTM sums gives what later became known as the Rocha-Caridi formula for the Virasoro characters. Thus we provide a proof of the fermionic q-series representation for the Virasoro characters for p=4 (the case p=3 is ``trivial''), in addition to extending the remarkable connection between CFT and off-critical RSOS models. We also discuss finitizations of the CFT modular-invariant partition functions.	0	61	47

New Poisson brackets	The ordinary Poisson brackets in field theory do not fulfil the Jacobi identity if boundary values are not reasonably fixed by special boundary conditions. We show that these brackets can be modified by adding some surface terms to lift this restriction. The new brackets generalize a canonical bracket considered by Lewis, Marsden, Montgomery and Ratiu for the free boundary problem in hydrodynamics. Our definition of Poisson brackets permits to treat boundary values of a field on equal footing with its internal values and directly estimate the brackets between both surface and volume integrals. This construction is applied to any local form of Poisson brackets. A prescription for delta-function on closed domains and a definition of the {\it full} variational derivative are proposed.	0	26	15

We obtain an effective scattering equation for this wavefunction which resembles the integral equation for the wavefunction of the particle in the absence of the bath. We show that the effect of the interaction is to renormalize the mass and the potential of the problem and that these new parameters can be solely described in terms of the spectral function of the excitations of the system.	1	0	0

The quantization of motion along the Jahn-Teller manifold leads to a symmetric-top rotator Hamiltonian.

We show that, in the same way, topological sigma-models in 4 dimensions introduce a path integral approach to the study of triholomorphic maps q:M-->N from a 4dimensional Riemannian manifold M to an almost quaternionic manifold N. The most interesting cases are those where M, N are hyperKahler or quaternionic Kahler. BRST-cohomology translates into intersection theory in the moduli-space of this new class of instantonic maps, named by us hyperinstantons. The definition of triholomorphicity that we propose is expressed by the equation q_*-J_u q_* j_u = 0, u=1,2,3, where {j_u} is an almost quaternionic structure on M and {J_u} is an almost quaternionic structure on N. This is a generalization of the Cauchy-Fueter equations. For M, N hyperKahler, this generalization naturally arises by obtaining the topological sigma-model as a twisted version of the N=2 globally supersymmetric sigma-model.

gr-qc/9306025	Open Questions in Classical Gravity	We discuss some outstanding open questions regarding the validity and uniqueness of the standard second order Newton-Einstein classical gravitational theory. On the observational side we discuss the degree to which the realm of validity of Newton's Law of Gravity can actually be extended to distances much larger than the solar system distance scales on which the law was originally established. On the theoretical side we identify some commonly accepted but actually still open to question assumptions which go into the formulating of the standard second order Einstein theory in the first place. In particular, we show that while the familiar second order Poisson gravitational equation (and accordingly its second order covariant Einstein generalization) may be sufficient to yield Newton's Law of Gravity they are not in fact necessary. The standard theory thus still awaits the identification of some principle which would then make it necessary too. We show that current observational information does not exclusively mandate the standard theory, and that the conformal invariant fourth order theory of gravity considered recently by Mannheim and Kazanas is also able to meet the constraints of data, and in fact to do so without the need for any so far unobserved non-luminous or dark matter.	0	3	1

Because tensor perturbations give rise to anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation (CBR) solely through the Sachs-Wolfe effect we are able to calculate analytically the variance of the multipole moments of this part of the CBR temperature anisotropy. In so doing, we carefully take account of the contribution of tensor perturbations that entered the Hubble radius during both the matter-dominated and radiation-dominated epoch by means of a transfer function. The striking feature in the spectrum of multipole amplitudes is a dramatic fall off for $l\ga \sqrt{1+\zl}$, where $\zl$ is the red shift of the last-scattering surface. ...	0	110	80

It is our goal to understand the origin of these many arbitrary parameters. In this talk we consider a supersymmetric [SUSY] SO(10) grand unified theory [GUT].

gr-qc/9307016	The origin of spacetime topology and generalizations of quantum field theory	The research effort reported in this paper is directed, in a broad sense, towards understanding the small-scale structure of spacetime. The fundamental question that guides our discussion is ``what is the physical content of spacetime topology?" In classical physics, if spacetime, $(X, \tau )$, has sufficiently regular topology, and if sufficiently many fields exist to allow us to observe all continuous functions on $X$, then this collection of continuous functions uniquely determines both the set of points $X$ and the topology $\tau$ on it. To explore the small-scale structure of spacetime, we are led to consider the physical fields (the observables) not as classical (continuous functions) but as quantum operators, and the fundamental observable as not the collection of all continuous functions but the local algebra of quantum field operators. In pursuing our approach further, we develop a number of generalizations of quantum field theory through which it becomes possible to talk about quantum fields defined on arbitrary topological spaces. Our ultimate generalization dispenses with the fixed background topological space altogether and proposes that the fundamental observable should be taken as a lattice (or more specifically a ``frame," in the sense of set theory) of closed subalgebras of an abstract $C^{\ast}$ algebra.

Choosing a renormalization scheme in the full theory fixes the renormalization scheme in the effective theory except for the scale of the heavy quark field. Explicit formulae are given for the effective Lagrangian, and one--loop matching renormalization constants are computed for the operators of order $1/m$.

The electromagnetic response function for these states at arbitrary frequency and wavevector can be calculated using a semiclassical approximation or the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). However, such calculations do not properly take into account the large effective mass renormalization which is present in the Chern-Simons theory. We show how the mass renormalization can be incorporated in a calculation of the response function within a Landau Fermi liquid theory approach such that Kohn's theorem and the $f$-sum rules are properly satisfied. We present results of such calculations.	1	6	6

We determine eigenenergies of the quantized $S^3$ skyrmion by solving the Schr\"odinger equation of the breathing mode for several lower spin and isospin states varying the Skyrme term constants $e$. When $S^3$ radius is smaller than $2/ef_\pi$, where $f_\pi$ is the pion decay constant, we always obtain a conformal map solution as the lowest eigenenergy state. In the conformal map case, allowed states have only symmetric or anti-symmetric wave function under inversion of a dynamical variable describing the breathing mode. As the $S^3$ radius increases the energy splitting between the symmetric and anti-symmetric states rapidly decreases and two states become completely degenerate state. When the $S^3$ radius larger than $3/ef_\pi$, for the small Skyrme term constant $e$ the lowest eigenenergy states are obtained with the profile function given by an arccosine form which is almost the same to those of usual $R^3$ skyrmion. When the effects of the Skyrme term are weak, i.e. large $e$, the lowest energy states are obtained by the profile function of conformal map, which correspond to the \lc\lc frozen states" for the $R^3$ skyrmion as the limit of $S^3$ radius $ \to \infty$.	0	0	0

We present results for heavy particle thresholds in more realistic models with gauge group $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$.

Such light stop could explain the slight excess of the high $p_{T}$ cross section of the $D^{*\pm}$-meson production in two-photon process at TRISTAN.

This formulation extends also to {\it non minimal} models. Moreover, in this framework the algebraic analogy between pure super Yang--Mills theories and pure supergravity in $D=10$ is manifest. As an additional outcome in the present formulation the supersymmetric partner of the ABBJ-Lorentz anomaly in pure $D=10$ supergravity can be computed in complete analogy to the ABBJ-gauge anomaly in supersymmetric Yang--Mills theories in ten dimensions. In the same framework we attack the issue of duality in $N=1$, $D=11$ supergravity showing in detail that duality holds at the kinematical level in superspace while it is broken by the dynamics. We discuss also possible extensions of this theory which could be related to quantum corrections of the eleven dimensional membrane.	0	28	27
hep-th/9310113	String Theory and Integrable Systems	This is mainly a brief review of some key achievements in a `hot'' area of theoretical and mathematical physics. The principal aim is to outline the basic structures underlying {\em integrable} quantum field theory models with {\em infinite-dimensional} symmetry groups which display a radically new type of {\em quantum group} symmetries. Certain particular aspects are elaborated upon with some detail: integrable systems of Kadomtsev-Petviashvili type and their reductions appearing in matrix models of strings; Hamiltonian approach to Lie-Poisson symmetries; quantum field theory approach to two-dimensional relativistic integrable models with dynamically broken conformal invariance. All field-theoretic models in question are of primary relevance to diverse branches of physics ranging from nonlinear hydrodynamics to string theory of fundamental particle interactions at ultra-high energies.	0	1	0
hep-ph/9310362	Light-Quark, Heavy-Quark Systems: An Update	We review many of the recently developed applications of Heavy Quark Effective Theory techniques. After a brief update on Luke's theorem, we describe striking relations between heavy baryon form factors, and how to use them to estimate the accuracy of the extraction of $|V_{cb}|$. We discuss factorization and compare with experiment. An elementary presentation, with sample applications, of reparametrization invariance comes next. The final and most extensive chapter in this review deals with phenomenological lagrangians that incorporate heavy-quark spin-flavor as well as light quark chiral symmetries. We compile many interesting results and discuss the validity of the calculations.	0	0	0
hep-ph/9311210	Evaluating Sums over the Matsubara Frequencies	Perturbative calculations in field theory at finite temperature involve sums over the Matsubara frequencies. Besides the usual difficulties that appear in perturbative computations, these sums give rise to some new obstacles that are carefully analized here. I present a fast and realible recipe to work out sums over the Matsubara frequencies. As this algorithm leads to deal with very cumbersome algebraic expressions, it has been written for computers by using the symbolic manipulation program Mathematica. It is also shown this algorithm to be self-consistent when it is applied to more than one loop computations.	0	5	0
cond-mat/9311020	Spin Excitations and Sum Rules in the Heisenberg Antiferromagnet	Various bounds for the energy of collective excitations in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet are presented and discussed using the formalism of sum rules. We show that the Feynman approximation significantly overestimates (by about 30\% in the $S={1\over2}$ square lattice) the spin velocity due to the non negligible contribution of multi magnons to the energy weighted sum rule. We also discuss a different, Goldstone type bound depending explicitly on the order parameter (staggered magnetization). This bound is shown to be proportional to the dispersion of classical spin wave theory with a q-independent normalization factor. Rigorous bounds for the excitation energies in the anisotropic Heisenberg model are also presented.	1	3	3
hep-th/9311120	New Black Hole, String and Membrane Solutions of the Four-Dimensional Heterotic String	We present solutions of the low-energy four-dimensional heterotic string corresponding to $p$-branes with $p=0,1,2$, which are characterized by a mass per unit $p$-volume, ${\cal M}_{p+1}$, and topological ``magnetic'' charge, $g_{p+1}$. In the extremal limit, $\sqrt{2} \kappa {\cal M}_{p+1} = g_{p+1}$, they reduce to the recently discovered non-singular supersymmetric monopole, string and domain wall solutions. A novel feature is that the solutions involve both the dilaton and the modulus fields. In particular, the effective scalar coupling to the Maxwell field, $e^{-\alpha \phi} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$, gives rise to a new string black hole with $\alpha = \sqrt{3}$, in contrast to the pure dilaton black hole solution which has $\alpha=1$. This means that electric/magnetic duality in $D=4$ may be seen as a consequence of string/fivebrane duality in $D=10$.	0	57	57
hep-ph/9311323	On the Evaluation of Threshold Effects in Processes Involving Heavy Quarks	A detailed evaluation is presented of production of heavy fermions (particularly ttbar quarks) by a vector current, in the region around threshold. This includes bound states as well as the region above threshold, to the same degree of accuracy; in both cases radiative and nonperturbative corrections are included. The contribution of this region to the vacuum polarization (``threshold effects'') is calculated and compared with a perturbative calculation; the importance of the threshold effects is found substantially smaller than claimed by some authors. Open fermion-antifermion production is also discussed.	0	5	5
solv-int/9311001	Continuous vacua in bilinear soliton equations	We discuss the freedom in the background field (vacuum) on top of which the solitons are built. If the Hirota bilinear form of a soliton equation is given by $A(D_{\vec x})\bd GF=0,\, B(D_{\vec x})(\bd FF - \bd GG)=0$ where both $A$ and $B$ are even polynomials in their variables, then there can be a continuum of vacua, parametrized by a vacuum angle $\phi$. The ramifications of this freedom on the construction of one- and two-soliton solutions are discussed. We find, e.g., that once the angle $\phi$ is fixed and we choose $u=\arctan G/F$ as the physical quantity, then there are four different solitons (or kinks) connecting the vacuum angles $\pm\phi$, $\pm\phi\pm\Pi2$ (defined modulo $\pi$). The most interesting result is the existence of a ``ghost'' soliton; it goes over to the vacuum in isolation, but interacts with ``normal'' solitons by giving them a finite phase shift.	0	0	0

The chiral prediction for the spin-averaged forward Compton scattering amplitude is in good agreement with the data for photon energies $\omega \le 110$ MeV. We also evaluate the nucleon electric and magnetic Compton polarizabilities to this order and discuss the uncertainties of the various counter terms entering the chiral expansion of these quantities.	0	72	31
hep-th/9311164	Hot Gauge Theories and $Z_{N}$ Phases	In this paper the several aspects of the $Z_{N}$ symmetry in gauge theories at high temperatures are discussed. The metastable $Z_{N}$ bubbles in the $SU(N)$ gauge theories with fermions may have, generically, unacceptable thermodynamic behavior. Their free energy $F \propto T^4$ with a positive proportionality constant. This leads not only to negative pressure but also to negative specific heat and, more seriously, to negative entropy. We argue that although such domains are important in the Euclidean theory, they cannot be interpreted as physical domains in Minkowski space. The related problem is connected with the analysis of the high-temperature limit of the confining phase. Using the two-dimensional QCD with adjoint fermions as a toy model we shall demonstrate that in the light fermion limit in this theory there is no breaking of the $Z_{N}$ symmetry in the high-temperature limit and thus there are no $Z_{N}$ bubbles.	0	21	6
hep-ph/9312203	The Momentum--Space Bosonization of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model with Vector and Axial-Vector Mesons	The momentum-space bosonization method is extended to the case of a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type model with vector and axial-vector mesons. The method presented gives the possibility of deriving any meson vertex function to all orders in momenta and to the leading order in $1/N_c$. Two-point functions, which describe one-particle transitions to the hadronic vacuum, and meson self-energies are considered. We find new relations which generalize the well-known KSFR relation and both the first and the second Weinberg sum rules. These result from a consistent treatment of higher order terms in the momentum expansion.	0	20	19
hep-ph/9312252	Chiral Symmetry Restoration at Finite Temperature in the Linear Sigma--Model	The temperature behaviour of meson condensates $<\sigma_0>$ and $<\sigma_8>$ is calculated in the $SU(3)\times SU(3)$-linear sigma model. The couplings of the Lagrangian are fitted to the physical $\pi,K,\eta,\eta'$ masses, the pion decay constant and a $O^+(I=0)$ scalar mass of $m_\sigma=1.5$ GeV. The quartic terms of the mesonic interaction are converted to a quadratic term with the help of a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Effective mass terms are generated this way, which are treated self-consistently to leading order of a $1/N$-expansion. We calculate the light $<\bar q q>$ and strange $<\bar s s>$-quark condensates using PCAC relations between the meson masses and condensates. For a cut-off value of 1.5 GeV we find a first-order chiral transition at a critical temperature $T_c\sim 161$ MeV. At this temperature the spontaneously broken subgroup $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ is restored. Entropy density, energy density and pressure are calculated for temperatures up to and slightly above the critical temperature. To our surprise we find some indications for a reduced contribution from strange mesons for $T\geq T_c$.	0	16	12
astro-ph/9312028	Robust Morphological Measures for Large-Scale Structure in the Universe	We propose a novel method for the description of spatial patterns formed by a coverage of point sets representing galaxy samples. This method is based on a complete family of morphological measures known as Minkowski functionals, which includes the topological Euler characteristic and geometric descriptors to specify the content, shape and connectivity of spatial sets. The method is numerically robust even for small samples, independent of statistical assumptions, and yields global as well as local morphological information. We illustrate the method by applying it to a Poisson process, a `double-Poisson' process, and to the Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters.	0	170	155

By taking the typical concerned decays as examples, such as $B_c$ meson decaying to $J/\psi + (\bar l \nu)$, the advantages of the approach and its limitations are illustrated. Finally, potential applications to various processes for possible double heavy flavoured systems, such as those of $(Q' \bar Q)$ and $(Q' Q)$ ($m_Q, m_{Q'}\gg \Lambda_{QCD}$), are discussed.	0	11	10
solv-int/9401003	On a Shallow Water Wave Equation	In this paper we study a shallow water equation derivable using the Boussinesq approximation, which includes as two special cases, one equation discussed by Ablowitz et. al. [Stud. Appl. Math., 53 (1974) 249--315] and one by Hirota and Satsuma [J. Phys. Soc. Japan}, 40 (1976) 611--612]. A catalogue of classical and nonclassical symmetry reductions, and a Painleve analysis, are given. Of particular interest are families of solutions found containing a rich variety of qualitative behaviours. Indeed we exhibit and plot a wide variety of solutions all of which look like a two-soliton for t>0 but differ radically for t<0. These families arise as nonclassical symmetry reduction solutions and solutions found using the singular manifold method. This example shows that nonclassical symmetries and the singular manifold method do not, in general, yield the same solution set. We also obtain symmetry reductions of the shallow water equation solvable in terms of solutions of the first, third and fifth Painleve equations. We give evidence that the variety of solutions found which exhibit ``nonlinear superposition'' is not an artefact of the equation being linearisable since the equation is solvable by inverse scattering. These solutions have important implications with regard to the numerical analysis for the shallow water equation we study, which would not be able to distinguish the solutions in an initial value problem since an exponentially small change in the initial conditions can result in completely different qualitative behaviours.	0	3	0
hep-ph/9401277	Exclusive Radiative B-Decays in the Light-Cone QCD Sum Rule Approach	We carry out a detailed study of exclusive radiative rare $B$-decays in the framework of the QCD sum rules on the light cone, which combines the traditional QCD sum rule technique with the description of final state vector mesons in terms of the light-cone wave functions of increasing twist. The decays considered are: $B_{u,d} \to K^* +\gamma, B_{u,d}\to \rho+\gamma, B_d\to \omega+\gamma$ and the corresponding decays of the $B_s$ mesons, $B_s\to \phi+\gamma$ and $B_s\to K^*+\gamma$. Based on our estimate of the transition form factor $F_1^{B \to K^*\pg}(0) =0.32\pm0.05$, we find for the branching ratio $BR(B \to K^* + \gamma) = (4.8\pm 1.5)\times 10^{-5}$, which is in agreement with the observed value measured by the CLEO collaboration. We present detailed estimates for the ratios of the radiative decay form factors, which are then used to predict the rates for the exclusive radiative B-decays listed above. This in principle allows the extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{td}|$ from the penguin-dominated CKM-suppressed radiative decays when they are measured. We give a detailed discussion of the dependence of the form factors on the $b$-quark mass and on the momentum transfer, as well as their interrelation with the CKM-suppressed semileptonic decay form factors in $B\to \rho+\ell+\nu$, which we also calculate in our approach.	0	180	166
hep-lat/9401018	Multicanonical study of $D=2$ $O(3)$ nonlinear $σ$-model	We present a new and exploratory approach to determine the $\Delta\beta(\beta)$-shift in the $O(3)$ nonlinear $\sigma$-model. The method is based on a scaling hypothesis for a free energy difference, which is assumed to be valid in a situation where the mass gap correlation length $\xi$ is of the order or larger than the linear extent $L$ of the considered square lattice sizes. The free energy difference arises from the finite volume constraint effective potential of the theory. While the constraint effective potential is calculated in numerical simulations employing a variant of the multicanonical ensemble on medium sized lattices, it is possible to estimate $\Delta\beta(\beta)$ up to a value of $\beta=2.8$ in the standard parameterization of the model.	0	2	1

We therefore examine the possibility of producing particles of this type in virtual $\gamma \gamma$ collisions at the LHC. Since photons can be emitted from protons which do not break up in the radiation process, very clean events can be generated, compensating to some extent for the small event numbers. Higher rates are expected, at the expense of stray hadrons, for events in which one or two protons break up.	0	42	36

Especially the elliptic genera are computed in general and, for a class of models recently invented by Distler and Kachru, they are compared with the ones from (0,2) sigma models. Our formalism gives an easy way to calculate the generation numbers for lots of Distler-Kachru models even if they are based on singular Calabi-Yau spaces. We also make some general remarks on the Born-Oppenheimer calculation of the ground states elucidating its mathematical meaning in the untwisted sector. For Distler-Kachru models based on non-singular Calabi-Yau spaces we show that there exist `residue' type formulas of the elliptic genera as well.	0	40	39
gr-qc/9403004	The Impossibility of Steady-State Inflation	Inflation is known to be generically eternal to the future: the false vacuum is thermalized in some regions of space, while inflation continues in other regions. Here, we address the question of whether inflation can also be eternal to the past. We argue that such a steady-state picture is impossible and, therefore, that inflation must have had a beginning. First, it is shown that the old inflationary model is not past-eternal. Next, some necessary conditions are formulated for inflationary spacetimes to be past-eternal and future-eternal. It is then shown that these conditions cannot simultaneously hold in physically reasonable open universes.	0	7	3

gr-qc/9403016	Discrete Self-Similiarity and Critical Point Behavior in Fluctuations About Extremal Black Holes	The issues of scaling symmetry and critical point behavior are studied for fluctuations about extremal charged black holes. We consider the scattering and capture of the spherically symmetric mode of a charged, massive test field on the background spacetime of a black hole with charge $Q$ and mass $M$. The spacetime geometry near the horizon of a $|Q|=M$ black hole has a scaling symmetry, which is absent if $|Q|<M$, a scale being introduced by the surface gravity. We show that this symmetry leads to the existence of a self-similiar solution for the charged field near the horizon, and further, that there is a one parameter family of discretely self-similiar solutions . The scaling symmetry, or lack thereof, also shows up in correlation length scales, defined in terms of the rate at which the influence of an external source coupled to the field dies off. It is shown by constructing the Greens functions, that an external source has a long range influence on the extremal background, compared to a correlation length scale which falls off exponentially fast in the $|Q|<M$ case. Finally it is shown that in the limit of $\Delta \equiv (1-{Q^2 \overM^2} )^{1\over 2} \rightarrow 0$ in the background spacetime, that infinitesimal changes in the black hole area vary like $\Delta ^{1\over 2}$.	0	20	16

Accurate theoretical gravitational-waveform templates will be needed to carry out matched filtering data analysis of the detectors' output once they are on the air by the end of this decade. For all but the final, strongly general relativistic coalescence of the two bodies, high-order post-Newtonian methods are playing a major role in the theorists' efforts to develop the needed templates.

hep-th/9404016	Noether's Theorem and time-dependent quantum invariants	The time dependent-integrals of motion, linear in position and momentum operators, of a quantum system are extracted from Noether's theorem prescription by means of special time-dependent variations of coordinates. For the stationary case of the generalized two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the time-independent integrals of motion are shown to correspond to special Bragg-type symmetry properties. A detailed study for the non-stationary case of this quantum system is presented. The linear integrals of motion are constructed explicitly for the case of varying mass and coupling strength. They are obtained also from Noether's theorem. The general treatment for a multi-dimensional quadratic system is indicated, and it is shown that the time-dependent variations that give rise to the linear invariants, as conserved quantities, satisfy the corresponding classical homogeneous equations of motion for the coordinates.	0	7	0

We consider the finite temperature behavior of the symmetry broken phase, and claim a restoration of the topological invariance at some critical temperature.

cond-mat/9404084	Universal Spectral Correlations in Diffusive Quantum Systems	We have studied numerically several statistical properties of the spectra of disordered electronic systems under the influence of an Aharonov Bohm flux $\varphi$, which acts as a time--reversal symmetry breaking parameter. The distribution of curvatures of the single electron energy levels has a modified Lorentz form with different exponents in the GOE and GUE regime. It has Gaussian tails in the crossover regime. The typical curvature is found to vary as $ -E_c\ln (E_c\varphi^2/\Delta)$ ($E_c$ is the Thouless energy and $\Delta$ the mean level spacing) and to diverge at zero flux. We show that the harmonics of the variation with $\varphi$ of single level quantities (current or curvature) are correlated, in contradiction with the perturbative result. The single level current correlation function is found to have a logarithmic behavior at low flux, in contrast to the pure symmetry cases. The distribution of single level currents is non--Gaussian in the GOE--GUE transition regime. We find a universal relation between $g_d$, the typical slope of the levels, and $g_c$, the width of the curvature distribution, as was proposed by Akkermans and Montambaux. We conjecture the validity of our results for any chaotic quantum system.	1	0	0

The action is defined as a (1,0) locally supersymmetric $SU(2)/U(1)$ coset perturbed by the cosmological constant-like term. The perturbation is such that it preserves the integrability of the coset model. Because of supersymmetry the perturbed theory is an exact quantum system provided a proper dilaton is taken into account. The exact value of the dilaton is determined in the supersymmetric case by the quasi-classical background of the bosonic coset.	0	1	1

gr-qc/9405037	Analytic Results for the Gravitational Radiation from a Class of Cosmic String Loops	Cosmic string loops are defined by a pair of periodic functions ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$, which trace out unit-length closed curves in three-dimensional space. We consider a particular class of loops, for which ${\bf a}$ lies along a line and ${\bf b}$ lies in the plane orthogonal to that line. For this class of cosmic string loops one may give a simple analytic expression for the power $\gamma$ radiated in gravitational waves. We evaluate $\gamma$ exactly in closed form for several special cases: (1) ${\bf b}$ a circle traversed $M$ times; (2) ${\bf b}$ a regular polygon with $N$ sides and interior vertex angle $\pi-2\pi M/N$; (3) ${\bf b}$ an isosceles triangle with semi-angle $\theta$.

We deform a free-fermionic model by introducing exactly marginal operators in the form of Abelian Thirring interactions on the world-sheet, and show that their couplings correspond to the untwisted moduli fields. We study the consequences of this method for simple free-fermionic models which correspond to $Z_2\times Z_2$ orbifolds and obtain their moduli space and K\"ahler potential by symmetry arguments and by direct calculation of string scattering amplitudes. We then generalize our analysis to more complicated fermionic structures which arise in constructions of realistic models corresponding to asymmetric orbifolds, and obtain the moduli space and K\"ahler potential for this case. Finally we extend our analysis to the untwisted matter sector and derive expressions for the full K\"ahler potential to be used in phenomenological applications, and the target space duality transformations of the corresponding untwisted matter fields.	0	21	4
astro-ph/9405047	Recalibration of the H$_{\bf -0.5}$ Magnitudes of Spiral Galaxies	The H magnitude aperture data published by the Aaronson et al. collaboration over a 10-year period is collected into a homogeneous data set of 1731 observations of 665 galaxies. 96\% of these galaxies have isophotal diameters and axial ratios determined by the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), the most self-consistent set of optical data currently available. The precepts governing the optical data in the RC3 are systematically different from those of the Second Reference Catalogue (de Vaucouleurs, de Vaucouleurs and Corwin 1976), which were used by Aaronson et al. for their original analyses of galaxy peculiar motions. This in turn leads to systematic differences in growth curves and fiducial H magnitudes, prompting the present recalibration of the near-infrared Tully Fisher relationship. New optically-normalized H magnitude growth curves are defined for galaxies of types S0 to Im, from which new values of fiducial H magnitudes, H$\rm _{-0.5}^g$, are measured for the 665 galaxies. A series of internal tests show that these four standard growth curves are defined to an accuracy of 0.05 mag over the interval $\rm -1.5 \leq \log (A/D_g) \leq -0.2$. Comparisons with the Aaronson et al. values of diameters, axial ratios and fiducial H magnitudes show the expected differences, given the different definitions of these parameters. The values of H$\rm _{-0.5}^g$ are assigned quality indices; a value of 1 indicates an accuracy of $<$0.2 magnitude; Quality 2 indicates an accuracy of 0.2 to 0.35 mag; and Quality 3 indicates $>$0.35 mag. Revised values of corrected HI velocity widths are also given, based on the new set of axial ratios defined by the RC3.	0	0	0

In this paper, we show that similar embeddings are also possible for $N$-extended superstrings at non-critical central charge. For any $x$, the embedding is $(N=0,c=26+x) \to (N=1,c=15+x) \to (N=2,c=6+x) \to (N=3,c=x) \to (N=4,c=x)$. As was conjectured by Vafa, the $(N=2,c=9) \to (N=3,c=3)$ embedding can be used to prove that $N=0$ topological strings are special vaccua of N=1 topological strings.	0	15	15
gr-qc/9405054	Is minimal coupling procedure compatible with minimal action principle?	When space-time is assumed to be non-Riemannian the minimal coupling procedure (MCP) is not compatible, in general, with minimal action principle (MAP). This means that the equations gotten by applying MCP to the Euler-Lagrange equations of a Lagrangian $\cal L$ do not coincide with the Euler-Lagrange equations of the Lagrangian obtained by applying MCP to $\cal L$. Such compatibility can be restored if the space-time admits a connection-compatible volume element. We show how these concepts can alter qualitatively the predictions of the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity.	0	4	4

Some corollaries are then presented as well as results conserning the separability assumption on $X$. Similar results for the NearRNP and the WeakRNP are also presented.	0	0	0

The BSs in M3 are overabundant at large radii, and significantly underabundant at intermediate radii. Here we present the result of a simulation of the dynamical evolution of a population of BSs in a multi--mass model of M3. Assuming the BSs were formed in the core through binary interactions (Hut \&\ Verbunt 1983, Leonard 1989, Sigurdsson \&\ Phinney 1993, Hut \etal 1992, Davies, Benz and Hills 1994), and given some very general assumptions about the recoil that occurs during stellar mergers in interacting binaries; we find an excellent fit to the observed radial distribution of BSs, suggesting strongly that most of the BSs in M3 were formed through binary collisions in the core.	0	0	0

We drive here a stability criterion for fireballs and show that fireballs are Rayleigh-Taylor unstable in any region in which the entropy decreases outward. The instability begins to operate when the fireball becomes matter dominated. Among the possible implication of the instability are: (i) Conversion of a fraction of the radiation energy to a convective energy expressed in the motion of bubbles relative to each other. (ii) Penetration of fast bubbles through slower ones and creation of high $\gamma$ regimes which are essential for efficient conversion of the energy to $\gamma$-rays.

astro-ph/9406041	Simulations of Relativistic Extragalactic Jets	We describe a method for the numerical solution of the relativistic Euler equations which we have found to be both robust and efficient, and which has enabled us to simulate relativistic jets. The technique employs a solver of the Godunov-type, with approximate solution of the local Riemann problems, applied to laboratory frame variables. Lorentz transformations provide the rest frame quantities needed for the estimation of wave speeds, etc. This is applied within the framework of an adaptive mesh refinement algorithm, allowing us to perform high-resolution, 2-D simulations with modest computing resources. We present the results of nonrelativistic, and relativistic ($\gamma=5$ and $10$) runs, for adiabatic indices of $5/3$ and $4/3$. We find the same gross morphology in all cases, but the relativistic runs exhibit little instability and less well-defined structure internal to the jet: this might explain the difference between (relatively slow) BL~Lacs and (faster) QSOs. We find that the choice of adiabatic index makes a small but discernible difference to the structure of the shocked jet and ambient media.	0	0	0

Alpha helices are taken as the fundamental collective coordinates of the system, while the refolding is assumed to be mainly driven by solvent-induced hydrophobic forces. A quantitative model of these forces is developed and compared with experimental and theoretical results. The model is then tested by being employed in a simulation scheme designed to mimic solvent effects. Realistic dynamic trajectories of myoglobin are shown as it folds from an extended conformation to a close approximation of the native state. Various suggestive features of the process are discussed. The tenets of the model are further tested by folding the single-chain plant protein leghemoglobin.	1	0	0

hep-ph/9406381	W and Z Polarization Effects in Hadronic Collisions	A Monte Carlo study of the polar and azimuthal angular distributions of the lepton pair arising from the decay of a $W$ or $Z$ boson produced at high transverse momentum in hadronic collisions is presented. In the absence of cuts on the final state leptons, the lepton angular distribution in the gauge boson rest frame is determined by the gauge boson polarization. Numerical results for the lepton angular distributions in the Collins--Soper frame with acceptance cuts and energy resolution smearing applied to the leptons are presented. In the presence of cuts, the lepton angular distributions are dominated by kinematic effects rather than polarization effects, however, some polarization effects are still observable on top of the kinematic effects. Polarization effects are highlighted when the experimental distributions are divided by the Monte Carlo distributions obtained using isotropic gauge boson decay.	0	37	22

cond-mat/9406118	Cross relaxation and the bilayer coupling in YBCO	There is strong experimental evidence for substantial antiferromagnetic coupling between the CuO$_2$ planes of the bilayers in YBCO compounds. The acoustic mode of the spin excitation spectrum has been measured but the optic mode has not been observed. Theoretical estimates suggest values for the antiferromagnetic interplane coupling as large as 10 meV. It has been proposed that this coupling is responsible for the spin gap in the underdoped YBCO compounds. In the recently synthesized compounds Y$_2$Ba$_4$Cu$_7$O$_{15}$ with alternating single/double chain blocks, it is possible to distinguish between the CuO$_2$ planes in a bilayer. We propose a nuclear magnetic cross relaxation experiment to directly measure the strength of the coupling between the two planes of a bilayer. The temperature dependence and magnitude of this cross relaxation rate is predicted.	1	0	0

Close to the metal-insulator transition and $V=0$ there is good `particle-hole' symmetry, showing that the mapping from a two band model to a one band model is appropriate.

hep-th/9408023	Stationarity of Inflation and Predictions of Quantum Cosmology	We describe several different regimes which are possible in inflationary cosmology. The simplest one is inflation without self-reproduction of the universe. In this scenario the universe is not stationary. The second regime, which exists in a broad class of inflationary models, is eternal inflation with the self-reproduction of inflationary domains. In this regime local properties of domains with a given density and given values of fields do not depend on the time when these domains were produced. The probability distribution to find a domain with given properties in a self-reproducing universe may or may not be stationary, depending on the choice of an inflationary model. We give examples of models where each of these possibilities can be realized, and discuss some implications of our results for quantum cosmology. In particular, we propose a new mechanism which may help solving the cosmological constant problem.	0	91	48
chem-ph/9408002	Methods for molecular dynamics with nonadiabatic transitions	We show how the dynamically nonlocal formulation of classical nuclear motion in the presence of quantal electronic transitions presented many years ago by Pechukas can be localized in time using time dependent perturbation theory to give an impulsive force which acts when trajectories hop between electronic surfaces. The action of this impulsive force is completely equivalent to adjusting the nuclear velocities in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector so as to conserve energy, a procedure which is widely used in surface hopping trajectory methods. This is the first time the precise connection between these two formulations of the nonadiabatic dynamics problem has been considered. We also demonstrate that the stationary phase approximation to the reduced propagator at the heart of Pechukas' theory is not unitary due to its neglect of nonstationary paths. As such mixed quantum-classical evolution schemes based on this approximation are not norm conserving and in general must fail to give the correct branching between different competing electronic states. Tully's phase coherent, fewest switches branching algorithm is guaranteed to conserve the norm. The branching between different alternatives predicted by this approach, however, may be inaccurate, due to use of the approximate local dynamics. We explore the relative merits of these different approximations using Tully's 1D two state example scattering problems for which numerically exact results are easily obtained.	0	1	0

Periodic as well as antiperiodic boundary conditions are used. An attempt is made to relate the performance of multigrid (MG) and conjugate gradient (CG) algorithms for propagators with the distribution of the eigenvalues of~$\Dirac$. The convergence of the CG algorithm is determined only by the condition number~$\kappa$ and by the lattice size. Since~$\kappa$'s do not vary significantly when quarks become dynamic, CG convergence in unquenched fields can be predicted from quenched simulations. On the other hand, MG convergence is not affected by~$\kappa$ but depends on the spectrum in a more subtle way.	0	22	16

astro-ph/9408103	Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies from Topological Defects in an Open Universe	We present a general formalism for computing Cosmic Background Radiation (CBR) and density fluctuations in open models with stiff sources. We find analytic Green's functions for the linearized Einstein equations in the presence of stiff sources and use this formalism to estimate the amplitude and harmonic spectrum of microwave background fluctuations produced by topological defects in an open universe. Unlike inflationary models that predict a flat universe and a spectrum of CBR fluctuations that is enhanced at large angular scales, defect models predict that CBR fluctuations are suppressed on angular scales larger than that subtended by the curvature scale. In an $\Omega = 0.2 - 0.4$ universe, these models, when normalized to the amplitude of CBR fluctuations observed by COBE, require a moderate bias factor, $2-3$, to be compatible with the observed fluctuations in galaxy counts. In these models, accurate predictions can be made which are testable through CBR experiments in the near future. A CBR measurement of $\Omega$ would then be possible, up to the limit imposed by cosmic variance. We discuss some of the philosophical implications of an open model and propose a solution to the flatness problem.	0	11	9

For the special case of $G=SU(N)_L \times SU(N)_R$ broken down to the diagonal subgroup $H=SU(N)_V$, there is just one such term for $N\geq 3$, which for $N=3$ is the original Wess-Zumino-Witten term.	0	32	10
hep-lat/9409020	Screening of the topological charge in a correlated instanton vacuum	Screening of the topological charge due to he fermion-induced interactions is an important phenomenon, closely related with the resolution of the strong CP and U(1) problems. We study the mechanism of such screening in a 'correlated instanton vacuum', as opposed to the 'random' one. Both scalar and pseudoscalar gluonic correlators are analyzed by means of an observable that minimizes finite size effects. Screening of the topological charge is established. This allows us to calculate the $\eta'$ mass without having to invert the Dirac operator. We suggest that this method might be used in lattice QCD calculations as well. Our results for the screening of the topological charge are in agreement with the chiral Ward identities, and the scalar gluonic correlator satisfies a low energy theorem first derived by Novikov et al. \cite{Novikov-etal}. We also propose to evaluate the topological susceptibility in the Witten-Veneziano formula not in an infinite box in an world $without$ fermions but in an infinitesimal box in a world $with$ fermions.	0	41	13

We are mainly interested in results for general chiral angles but we consider also the superintegrable case. For the parameter values considered, we find that the band structure of the low- lying part of the excitation spectrum has the form expected from a quasiparticle picture with two fundamental particles. Studying the N-dependence of the spectrum, we confirm the stability of the second fundamental particle in a limited range of the momentum, even when its energy becomes so high that it lies very high up among the multiparticle scattering states. This is not a phenomenon restricted to the superintegrable line. Calculating a non-translationally invariant correlation function, we give evidence that it is oscillating. Within our numerical accuracy we find a relation between the oscillation length and the dip position of the momentum dispersion of the lightest particle which seems to be quite independent of the chiral angles.	0	2	1

The constraint of requiring the best matches to the mass functions and surface density profiles to occur simultaneously defines a surface in an initial parameter space consisting of the cluster concentration, mass, and limiting radius. I discuss various techniques for locating this surface and the dependence of the quality of the matches on the position of the model on the surface, the initial mass function and the retention rate of neutron stars. The quality of the matches are usually strongly related to the age of the models, but one initial mass function was found for which the quality of the matches are independent of time.	0	0	0

At the Tevatron center of mass energy, the QCD corrections to $WZ$ production are modest. At Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, the inclusive QCD corrections are large, but can be reduced significantly if a jet veto is imposed. Sensitivity limits for the anomalous $WWZ$ couplings are derived from the next-to-leading order $Z$ boson transverse momentum distribution for Tevatron and LHC energies. Unless a jet veto is imposed, next-to-leading order QCD corrections decrease the sensitivity to anomalous $WWZ$ couplings considerably at LHC energies, but have little influence at the Tevatron. We also study, at next-to-leading order, rapidity correlations between the $W$ and $Z$ decay products, and the $ZZ/WZ$ and $WZ/W\gamma$ cross section ratios. These quantities are found to be useful tools in searching for the approximate zero present in the Standard Model $WZ$ helicity amplitudes. The prospects for observing the approximate amplitude zero at the Tevatron and the LHC are critically assessed.	0	48	45
hep-ph/9410282	Non-local Electroweak Baryogenesis Part II : The Classical Regime	We investigate baryogenesis at a first order electroweak phase transition in the presence of a CP violating condensate on the bubble walls, in the regime in which the bubble walls are `thick', in the sense that fermions interact with the plasma many times as the bubble wall passes. Such a condensate is present in multi-Higgs extensions of the standard model and may be formed via an instability in the minimal standard model. We concentrate on particles with typical thermal energies in the plasma, whose interactions with the wall are accurately described by the WKB approximation, in which a classical chiral force is evident. The deviations from thermal equilibrium produced by motion of the wall are then treated using a classical Boltzmann equation which we solve in a fluid approximation. From the resulting equations we find two effects important for baryogenesis: (i) a classical chiral force term due to the $CP$ violating background, and (ii) a term arising from hypercharge violating interactions which are pushed out of equilibrium by the background{field. Provided the wall propagates slower than the speed of sound, both terms lead to the diffusion of a chiral asymmetry in front of the wall. This can produce a baryon asymmetry of the observed magnitude for typical wall velocities and thicknesses.	0	125	117

The Weyl equation thus appears as a consequence of the transformation behavior of local sections of half--canonical bundles under a change of charts. As a consequence, it is possible to impose covariant constraints on spinors of negative (positive) helicity in terms of (anti--)holomorphy conditions. Furthermore, the identification with half--differentials is employed to determine possible extensions of fermion propagators compatible with Lorentz covariance. This paper includes in particular the full derivation of the primary correlators needed in order to determine the fermion correlators.	0	2	1

Fixed-Energy Dispersion Relations for the Fast Decaying Potentials	For the two-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation $$ [- \Delta +v(x)]\psi=E\psi,\ x\in \R^2,\ E=E_{fixed}>0 \ \ \ \ \ (*)$$ at a fixed positive energy with a fast decaying at infinity potential $v(x)$ dispersion relations on the scattering data are given.Under "small norm" assumption using these dispersion relations we give (without a complete proof of sufficiency) a characterization of scattering data for the potentials from the Schwartz class $S=C_{\infty}^{(\infty)} (\hbox{\bf R}^2).$ For the potentials with zero scattering amplitude at a fixed energy $\scriptstyle E_{fixed}$ (transparent potentials) we give a complete proof of this characterization. As a consequence we construct a family (parameterized by a function of one variable) of two-dimensional spherically-symmetric real potentials from the Schwartz class $S$ transparent at a given energy. For the two-dimensional case (without assumption that the potential is small) we show that there are no nonzero real exponentially decreasing at infinity, potentials transparent at a fixed energy. For any dimension greater or equal 1 we prove that there are no nonzero real potentials with zero forward scattering amplitude at an energy interval. We show that KdV-type equations in dimension 2+1 related with the scattering problem $(*)$ (the Novikov-Veselov equations) do not preserve, in general, these dispersion relations starting from the second one. As a corollary these equations do not preserve, in general , the decay rate faster then $|x|^{-3}$ for initial data from the Schwartz class.	0	0	0

hep-ph/9411223	Probing CP in the Higgs Sector	We discuss how one may determine whether some Higgs particle is an eigenstate of $CP$ or not, and if so, how we may probe whether it is $CP$-odd or $CP$-even. The idea is applied to Higgs decay where correlations among momenta of the decay products may yield the desired information. These are correlations of decay planes defined by the momenta of pairs of particles as well as correlations between energy differences. In the case that the Higgs particle is an eigenstate of $CP$, our study includes finite-width effects. The correlations between energy differences turn out to be a much better probe for investigating $CP$ properties than the previously suggested angular correlations, especially for massive Higgs bosons.	0	1	1

Sizeable relativistic effects are found for certain transitions, for example, to radial excitations such as that conventionally used to describe to the Roper resonance. A systematic study shows that the violation of rotational covariance of the baryon transition matrix elements stemming from the use of one-body currents is generally small.	0	130	51
mtrl-th/9411006	Localized Basis for Effective Lattice Hamiltonians: Lattice Wannier Functions	A systematic method is presented for constructing effective Hamiltonians for general phonon-related structural transitions. The key feature is the application of group theoretical methods to identify the subspace in which the effective Hamiltonian acts and construct for it localized basis vectors, which are the analogue of electronic Wannier functions. The results of the symmetry analysis for the perovskite, rocksalt, fluorite and A15 structures and the forms of effective Hamiltonians for the ferroelectric transition in $PbTiO_3$ and $BaTiO_3$, the oxygen-octahedron rotation transition in $SrTiO_3$, the Jahn-Teller instability in $La_{1-x}(Ca,Sr,Ba)_xMnO_3$ and the antiferroelectric transition in $PbZrO_3$ are discussed. For the oxygen- octahedron rotation transition in $SrTiO_3$, this method provides an alternative to the rotational variable approach which is well behaved throughout the Brillouin zone. The parameters appearing in the Wannier basis vectors and in the effective Hamiltonian, given by the corresponding invariant energy expansion, can be obtained for individual materials using first- principles density-functional-theory total energy and linear response techniques, or any technique that can reliably calculate force constants and distortion energies. A practical approach to the determination of these parameters is presented and the application to ferroelectric $PbTiO_3$ discussed.	0	2	0

The earlier results on the finite-dimensional representations of $GL_q(2)$ and $SL_q(2)$ (or $SU_q(2)$) are obtained when $p$ $=$ $q$. Representations of $U_{\bar{q},q}(2)$ $(q$ $\in$ $\C \backslash \R$ and $U_q(2)$ $(q$ $\in$ $\R \backslash \{0\})$ are also considered. The structure of the Clebsch-Gordan matrix for $U_{p,q}(gl(2))$ is studied.

The relevant small parameter is $g=R_c{\sqrt T_0}$, where $R_c$ is the curvature of the spacetime and $T_0$ is the string tension. Within our systematic expansion we obtain to zeroth order the null string (string with zero tension), while the first order correction incorporates the string dynamics. We apply our formalism to quantum null strings in de Sitter spacetime. After a reparametrization of the world-sheet coordinates, the equations of motion are simplified. The quantum algebra generated by the constraints is considered, ordering the momentum operators to the right of the coordinate operators. No critical dimension appears. It is anticipated however that the conformal anomaly will appear when the first order corrections proportional to $T_0$, are introduced.	0	29	28

Mesons are described as q-bar q states interacting via a mixture of a scalar and a vector confining kernel and a one gluon exchange. The model parameters are fixed by a fit to the meson mass spectrum including also the light mesons. We calculate form factors and compare our results to the pole dominance hypothesis. From a fit to ARGUS and CLEO data on B -> D* semileptonic decay we extract the Cabbibo Kobayashi Maskawa matrix element to be V_cb= (0.032+-0.003)*sqrt(1.49ps/tau_B).

In the present paper we compare different definitions used in the literature and find that they correspond to different renormalization schemes in the physical operator basis. The scheme transformation formulae for the Wilson coefficients and the anomalous dimension matrix are derived in the next-to-leading order. We further investigate the proper treatment of evanescent operators in processes appearing at second order in the effective four-fermion interaction such as particle-antiparticle mixing, rare hadron decays or inclusive decays.	0	77	63

gr-qc/9502026	Linearized Einstein theory via null surfaces	Recently there has been developed a reformulation of General Relativity - referred to as {\it the null surface version of GR} - where instead of the metric field as the basic variable of the theory, families of three-surfaces in a four-manifold become basic. From these surfaces themselves, a conformal metric, conformal to an Einstein metric, can be constructed. A choice of conformal factor turns them into Einstein metrics. The surfaces are then automatically characteristic surfaces of this metric. In the present paper we explore the linearization of this {\it null surface theory} and compare it with the standard linear GR. This allows a better understanding of many of the subtle mathematical issues and sheds light on some of the obscure points of the null surface theory. It furthermore permits a very simple solution generating scheme for the linear theory and the beginning of a perturbation scheme for the full theory.	0	9	9

Clear signals in the mass difference $\Delta M$=$M$(D$^*$)--$M$(D$^0)$ as well as in the $M(K\pi)$ distribution at the D$^0$ mass are found. The $ep$ cross section for inclusive \DSpm\ production with $Q^2<4~\GeV^2$ in the $\gamma p$ centre-of-mass energy range $115 < W < 275$ \GeV\ has been determined to be $(32 \pm 7^{+4}_{-7} )$ nb in the kinematic region \mbox{\{$p_T(\DS)\geq $ 1.7 \,\GeV, $|\eta(\DS)| < 1.5 $\}}. Ex\-tra\-po\-la\-ting outside this region, assuming a mass of the charm quark of 1.5 \GeV, we estimate the $ep$ charm cross section to be $\sigma(e p \rightarrow c \bar{c}X ) = (0.45 \pm 0.11^{+0.37}_{-0.22}) \, \mu {\rm b} $ at \mbox{$\sqrt{s} = 296$}~\GeV\ and $\langle W \rangle = 198$ \GeV.

We show that the majoron emitting decays can have a sizeable branching ratio of $10^{-5}$ or so, without conflicting any experimental observation from neutrino physics or particle searches. These decays may lead to interesting structures for the single photon spectrum involving either mono chromatic photons as well as continuous spectra that grow with energy.

We will show the predictions we obtain after a straightforward DGLAP $Q^2$ evolution and comparison in a much broader $x$ and $Q^2$ range, with several recent and accurate deep-inelastic scattering data. In particular, we will see that we get an excellent agreement with the sharp rise of $F^{ep}_2(x,Q^2)$ for small $x$, recently observed at HERA.

We model measuring processes of a single spin-1/2 object and of a pair of spin-1/2 objects in the EPR-Bohm state by systems of differential equations. Our model is a local model with hidden-variables of the EPR-Bohm Gedankenexperiment. Although there is no dynamical interaction between a pair of spin-1/2 objects, the model can reproduce approximately the quantum-mechanical correlations by the coincidence counting. Hence the Bell inequality is violated. This result supports the idea that the coincidence counting is the source of the non-locality in the EPR-Bohm Gedankenexperiment.	0	0	0

The images are reduced and morphological features such as bulge size and the number of arms are extracted, all in a fully automated manner. The galaxy sample was first classified by 6 independent experts. We use several definitions for the mean type of each galaxy, based on those classifications. We then train and test the network on these features. We find that the rms error of the network classifications, as compared with the mean types of the expert classifications, is 1.8 Revised Hubble Types. This is comparable to the overall rms dispersion between the experts. This result is robust and almost completely independent of the network architecture used.	0	0	0

hep-th/9503060	STATIONARY STRINGS AND 2-D BLACK HOLES	A general description of string excitations in stationary spacetimes is developed. If a stationary string passes through the ergosphere of a 4-dimensional black hole, its world-sheet describes a 2-dimensional black (or white) hole with horizon coinciding with the static limit of the 4-dimensional black hole. Mathematical results for 2-dimensional black holes can therefore be applied to physical objects (say) cosmic strings in the vicinity of Kerr black holes. An immediate general result is that the string modes are thermally excited. The string excitations are determined by a coupled system of scalar field equations in the world-sheet metric. In the special case of excitations propagating along a stationary string in the equatorial plane of the Kerr-Newman black hole, they reduce to the $s$-wave scalar field equations in the 4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. We briefly discuss possible applications of our results to the black hole information puzzle.	0	13	8

This formula enables us to distinguish Dirac operators of simple type. For each Dirac operator of this natural class the local Atiyah-Singer index theorem holds. Furthermore, if $M$\ is compact and ${{\petit \rm dim}\;M=2n\ge 4}$, we derive an expression for the Wodzicki function $W_{\cal E}$, which is defined via the non-commutative residue on the space of all Dirac operators ${\cal D}({\cal E})$.

One has only to use the information on $\pi N$ elastic S-wave T-matrix at the $\eta$ production threshold, and near threshold $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow \eta n$ total cross section. The results are independent of the particular parametrization of the elastic T-matrix and of the number of channels. For the described model the unitarity requires that the number of channels must be at least three. These assumptions are more general then the assumptions of the existing single resonance models up to now used for extracting the $\eta N$ S-wave scattering length. The agreement of our approach with former estimates is anticipated and confirmed for all cases for which the input data agree with the commonly accepted values.	0	2	2

In this paper we classify unitary representations of this new algebra and identify the corresponding representation spaces with the spaces of conformal blocks of the WZW model. The mapping class group of the surface is proved to act on the moduli algebra by inner automorphisms. The generators of these automorphisms are unitary elements of the moduli algebra.

The description of the data is even better than that in the case of LO QCD. The FP-QCD parameter $~\alpha_0~$ is determined with a good accuracy: $~\alpha_0 = 0.198\pm 0.009~$. Having in mind the recent QCD fits to the same data we conclude that unlike the high precision and large $~(x,Q^2)~$ kinematic range of the CCFR data they cannot discriminate between QCD and FP - QCD predictions for $~xF_3(x,Q^2)~$.	0	0	0

hep-ph/9504364	Finite Supersymmetric Threshold Corrections to CKM Matrix Elements in the Large $tanβ$ Regime	We evaluate the finite 1-loop threshold corrections, proportional to $tan\beta$, to the down quark mass matrix. These result in corrections to down quark masses and to Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa [CKM] matrix elements. The corrections to CKM matrix elements are the novel feature of this paper. For grand unified theories with large $\tan\beta$ these corrections may significantly alter the low energy predictions of four of the CKM matrix elements and the Jarlskog parameter J, a measure of CP violation. The angles $\alpha,\: \beta$ and $\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle and the ratio $|{V_{ub} \over V_{cb}}|$, however, are not corrected to this order. We also discuss these corrections in the light of recent models for fermion masses. Here the corrections may be useful in selecting among the various models. Moreover, if one model fits the data, it will only do so for a particular range of SUSY parameters.	0	182	181

hep-th/9504122	A Search for New (2,2) Strings	There are at present two known string theories in $(2,2)$ dimensions. One of them is the well known $N=2$ string, and the other one is a more recently constructed $N=1$ spacetime supersymmetric string. They are both based on certain twistings and/or truncations of the small $N=4$ superconformal algebra, realised in terms of $(2,2)$ superspace variables. In this paper, we investigate more general possibilities for string theories based on algebras built with the same set of fields. We find that there exists one more string theory, based on an algebra which is not contained within the $N=4$ superconformal algebra. We investigate the spectrum and interactions of this theory.	0	6	6
math/9504213	Path optimization and near-greedy analysis for graph partitioning: an empirical study	This paper presents the results of an experimental study of graph partitioning. We describe a new heuristic technique, path optimization, and its application to two variations of graph partitioning: the max_cut problem and the min_quotient_cut problem. We present the results of computational comparisons between this technique and the Kernighan-Lin algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm, the FLOW-lagorithm the multilevel algorithm, and teh recent 0.878-approximation algorithm. The experiments were conducted on two classes of graphs that have become standard for such tests: random and random geometric. They show that for both classes of inputs and both variations of the problem, the new heuristic is competitive with the other algorithms and holds an advantage for min_quotient_cut when applied to very large, sparse geometric graphs. In the last part of the paper, we describe an approach to analyzing graph partitioning algorithms from the statistical point of view. Every partitioning of a graph is viewed as a result achieved by a "near gready" partitioning algorithm. The experiments show that for "good" partitionings, the number of non-greedy steps needed to obtain them is quite small; moreover, it is "statistically" smaller for better partitionings. This led us to conjecture that there exists an "optimal" distribution of the non-greedy steps that characterize the classes of graphs that we studied.	0	0	0
nucl-th/9504028	Kaon production cross sections from baryon-baryon interactions	In a one-pion plus one-kaon exchange model, we calculate the kaon production cross sections in nucleon-nucleon, nucleon-delta and delta-delta interactions. We find that this model describes reasonably well the experimental data on kaon production in the proton-proton interaction. Near the kaon production threshold, the cross section obtained from this model is smaller than that from the linear parameterization of Randrup and Ko. For kaon production cross sections from the nucleon-delta and delta-delta interactions, the cross sections are singular in free space, so we calculate them in a nuclear medium by including the (complex) pion self-energy. The results are compared with the scaling ansatz of Randrup and Ko. The theoretical cross sections are then used in a transport model to study kaon production from Au+Au collisions at 1 GeV/nucleon.	0	36	30

astro-ph/9510077	Is There A Cosmological Constant?	We present limits on the cosmological constant from the statistics of gravitational lenses using newly completed quasar surveys, new lens data, and a range of lens models. The formal limit is $\lambda_0 < 0.66$ at 95\% confidence in flat cosmologies, including the statistical uncertainties in the number of lenses, galaxies, quasars, and the parameters relating galaxy luminosities to dynamical variables. The limit holds for either softened isothermal or de Vaucouleurs models of the lens galaxies, suggesting that the radial mass distribution in the lens galaxy is not a significant systematic uncertainty. The cosmological limits are unaffected by adding a small core radius to the isothermal lens models or by the luminosity of the lens galaxy. Inconsistent models of the effects of a core radius make significant errors in the cosmological constraints. Extinction in E/S0 galaxies can significantly reduce the limits on the cosmological constant, but changing the expected number of lenses by a factor of two requires a minimum of 100 times more dust than is observed locally in E/S0 galaxies. Rapid evolution of the lenses is the most promising means of evading these limits. However, a viable model must not only reduce the expected number of lenses but do so without significantly altering the average image separations, magnitudes, redshifts, and the relative properties of optically and radio selected lenses.	0	309	299

A key feature of this model is the idea that the birth of black holes in the centers of supergiant galaxies is strongly influenced by the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe. This conjecture can successfully explain two observed phenomena: the alignment of the radio, optical and infrared axes of high-redshift radio galaxies, and the alignment of present-day cD galaxies with their environs. Other recent observational tests of this theory are also discussed.	0	0	0

Shortly after the quench, like in the bulk, a nonequilibrium regime governed by universal power laws is also found near the surface. We show for `ordinary' and `special' transitions that the corresponding critical exponents differ from their bulk values, but can be expressed via scaling relations in terms of known bulk and surface exponents. To corroborate our scaling analysis, we present perturbative (epsilon-expansion) and Monte Carlo results.	1	22	21

This calculation yields $\Delta_1=1/2$. A finite size scaling analysis of data generated for the continuum using a biased sampling Monte Carlo algorithm supports this value, as does a re--analysis of exact data for two--dimensional lattices.	1	1	1

The formalism is two-dimensionally covariant, and leads to simple, geometrically transparent and tractable expressions for the Einstein field equations and the Einstein-Hilbert action, and it should find a variety of applications.

hep-ph/9510258	The chiral phase transition in a random matrix model with molecular correlations	The chiral phase transition of QCD is analyzed in a model combining random matrix elements of the Dirac operator with specially chosen non-random ones. The special form of the latter is motivated by the assumption that the fermionic quasi-zero modes associated with instanton and anti-instanton configurations determine the chiral properties of QCD. Our results show that the degree of correlation between these modes plays the decisive role. To reduce the value of the chiral condensate by more than a factor of 2 about 95 percent of the instantons and anti-instantons must form so-called molecules. This conclusion agrees with numerical results of the Stony Brook group.	0	57	21
nucl-th/9510011	Hot nuclear matter with dilatons	We study hot nuclear matter in a model based on nucleon interactions deriving from the exchange of scalar and vector mesons. The main new feature of our work is the treatment of the scale breaking of quantum chromodynamics through the introduction of a dilaton field. Although the dilaton effects are quite small quantitatively, they affect the high-temperature phase transition appreciably. We find that inclusion of the dilaton leads to a metastable high-density state at zero pressure, similar to that found by Glendenning who considered instead the admixture of higher baryon resonances.	0	7	5
nucl-th/9510058	Rare-Earth Nuclei: Radii, Isotope-Shifts and Deformation Properties in the Relativistic Mean Field Theory	A systematic study of the ground-state properties of even-even rare earth nuclei has been performed in the framework of the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the parameter set NL-SH. Nuclear radii, isotope shifts and deformation properties of the heavier rare-earth nuclei have been obtained, which encompass atomic numbers ranging from Z=60 to Z=70 and include a large range of isospin. It is shown that RMF theory is able to provide a good and comprehensive description of the empirical binding energies of the isotopic chains. At the same time the quadrupole deformations $\beta_{2}$ obtained in the RMF theory are found to be in good agreement with the available empirical values. The theory predicts a shape transition from prolate to oblate for nuclei at neutron number N=78 in all the chains. A further addition of neutrons up to the magic number 82 brings about the spherical shape. For nuclei above N=82, the RMF theory predicts the well-known onset of prolate deformation at about N=88, which saturates at about N=102. The deformation properties display an identical behaviour for all the nuclear chains. A good description of the above deformation transitions in the RMF theory in all the isotopic chains leads to a successful reproduction of the anomalous behaviour of the empirical isotopic shifts of the rare-earth nuclei. The RMF theory exhibits a remarkable success in providing a unified and microscopic description of various empirical data.	0	17	16
nucl-th/9510060	Mesonic and Binding Contributions to the EMC Effect in a Relativistic Many Body Approach	We revise the conventional nuclear effects of Fermi motion, binding and pionic effects in deep inelastic lepton scattering using a relativistic formalism for an interacting Fermi sea and the local density approximation to translate results from nuclear matter to finite nuclei. In addition we also consider effects from rho-meson renormalization in the nucleus. The use of nucleon Green's functions in terms of their spectral functions offers a precise way to account for Fermi motion and binding. On the other hand the use of many body Feynman diagrams in a relativistic framework allows one to avoid using prescriptions given in the past to introduce relativistic corrections in a non relativistic formalism. We show that with realistic nucleon spectral functions and meson nucleus selfenergies one can get a reasonable description of the EMC effect for x > 0.15, outside the shadowing region.	0	35	27

We carry out an analytic stability analysis of this spatially synchronized and temporally periodic case and obtain the stability matrix in a neat block diagonal form. We find spatially synchronized behaviour over a substantial range of parameter space. We have also extended the analysis to higher spatial periods with similar results. Numerical simulations for various temporal periods of the synchronized solution, reveal that the entire structure of the Arnold tongues and the devil's staircase seen in the case of the single circle map can also be observed for the synchronized coupled sine circle map lattice. Our formalism should be useful in the study of spatially periodic behaviour in other coupled map lattices.	0	0	0
quant-ph/9510030	Acceleration of Quantum Fields	We analyze the transformation of quantum fields under conformal coordinate transformations from inertial to accelerated frames, in the simple case of scalar massless fields in a two-dimensional spacetime, through the transformation of particle number and its spectral density. Particle number is found to be invariant under conformal coordinate transformations to uniformly accelerated frames, which extends the property already known for vacuum. Transformation of spectral density of particle number exhibits a redistribution of particles in the frequency spectrum. This redistribution is determined by derivatives of phase operators with respect to frequency, that is by time and position operators defined in such a manner that the redistribution of particles appears as a Doppler shift which depends on position in spacetime, in conformity with Einstein equivalence principle.	0	0	0

gr-qc/9507014	Spin-3/2 Potentials in Backgrounds with Boundary	This paper studies the two-spinor form of the Rarita-Schwinger potentials subject to local boundary conditions compatible with local supersymmetry. The massless Rarita-Schwinger field equations are studied in four-real-dimensional Riemannian backgrounds with boundary. Gauge transformations on the potentials are shown to be compatible with the field equations providing the background is Ricci-flat, in agreement with previous results in the literature. However, the preservation of boundary conditions under such gauge transformations leads to a restriction of the gauge freedom. The recent construction by Penrose of secondary potentials which supplement the Rarita-Schwinger potentials is then applied. The equations for the secondary potentials, jointly with the boundary conditions, imply that the background four-geometry is further restricted to be totally flat. The analysis of other gauge transformations confirms that, in the massless case, the only admissible class of Riemannian backgrounds with boundary is totally flat.	0	2	1

To illustrate the power of this approach, we calculate the static-quark potential, and the charmonium spectrum and wavefunctions using a desktop computer. We obtain accurate results that are independent of the lattice spacing and agree well with experiment.	0	179	167

The model is based on semibosonized SU(2) Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio lagrangean, where the boson fields are treated as classical ones. Other observables, namely the nucleon mean squared radii, the magnetic moments, and the nucleon--$\Delta$ splitting are calculated as well. The calculations have been done taking into account the quark sea polarization effects. The final results, including rotational $1/N_c$ corrections, are compared with the existing experimental data, and they are found to be in a good agreement for the constituent quark mass of about 420 MeV. The only exception is the neutron electric form factor which is overestimated.	0	33	26

The prospects for probing the $WWV$ couplings in this reaction are explored. The impact of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ QCD corrections and various background processes on the observability of non-standard $WWV$ couplings in $W^+ W^-$ production at the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is discussed in detail. Sensitivity limits for anomalous $WWV$ couplings are derived at next-to-leading order for the Tevatron and LHC center of mass energies, and are compared to the bounds which can be achieved in other processes. Unless a jet veto or a cut on the total transverse momentum of the hadrons in the event is imposed, the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ QCD corrections and the background from top quark production decrease the sensitivity of $p\,p\hskip-7pt\hbox{$^{^{(\!-\!)}}$} \rightarrow W^{+} W^{-} + X \rightarrow \ell^+_1 \nu_1 \ell^-_2 \bar \nu_2 + X$ to anomalous $WWV$ couplings by a factor two to five.	0	42	38

hep-th/9507060	Topological Rigid String Theory and Two Dimensional QCD	We present a string theory that reproduces the large-$N$ expansion of two dimensional Yang-Mills gauge theory on arbitrary surfaces. First, a new class of topological sigma models is introduced, with path integrals localized to the moduli space of harmonic maps. The Lagrangian of these harmonic topological sigma models is of fourth order in worldsheet derivatives. Then we gauge worldsheet diffeomorphisms by introducing the induced worldsheet metric. This leads to a topological string theory, whose Lagrangian coincides in the bose sector with the rigid string Lagrangian discussed some time ago by Polyakov and others as a candidate for QCD string theory. The path integral of this topological rigid string theory is localized to the moduli spaces of minimal-area maps, and calculates their Euler numbers. The dependence of the large-$N$ QCD partition functions on the target area emerges from measuring the volume of the moduli spaces, and can be reproduced by adding a Nambu-Goto term (improved by fermionic terms) to the Lagrangian of the topological rigid string.	0	25	23

Pure gauge QCD_3 is defined on a strip of finite width L, which acts as an interpolating parameter between two and three dimensions. A two-dimensional effective theory can be constructed for small enough widths giving the same longitudinal physics as QCD_3. Explicit calculations of T-dependent QCD_3 observables can thus be performed. The generation of a deconfinig phase transition, absent in QCD_2, is proven through an exact calculation of the electric or Debye mass at high T. Low and high T behaviors of relevant thermodynamic functions are also worked out. An accurate estimate of the critical temperature is given and its evolution with L is studied in detail.	0	0	0

In cases where such conflicts are relevant to the task at hand, the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation as an attempt to square away the discrepancies in their beliefs. This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification. Furthermore, by capturing the negotiation process in a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, our model can successfully handle embedded negotiation subdialogues.	0	0	0

Syntactic rules are randomly generated and then evolve; those rules resulting in improved parsing and occasionally improved retrieval and filtering performance are allowed to further propagate. The LUST system learns the characteristics of the language or sublanguage used in document abstracts by learning from the document rankings obtained from the parsed abstracts. Unlike the application of traditional linguistic rules to retrieval and filtering applications, LUST develops grammatical structures and tags without the prior imposition of some common grammatical assumptions (e.g., part-of-speech assumptions), producing grammars that are empirically based and are optimized for this particular application.	0	0	0

Because of the large ratios of masses involved, these contributions are rather large. The result we obtain differs from a previous estimate reported in the literature. The discrepancy originates in the cancellation of anomalies in $SU(3)_c\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$, a cancellation that requires the consideration of both leptons {\it and} quarks within each generation and that had been previously overlooked.	0	102	98

Misaligned supersymmetry is a universal property of (1,0) string vacua which describes how the arrangement of bosonic and fermionic states at all string energy levels conspires to preserve finite string amplitudes, even in the absence of full spacetime supersymmetry. Misaligned supersymmetry also constrains the degree to which spacetime supersymmetry can be broken without breaking modular invariance, and is responsible for the vanishing of various mass supertraces evaluated over the infinite string spectrum.

Particular attention is given to its recently discovered superconducting phase with a $T_c$ of 16.4 K, reported to have the NbO structure type. Results of total energy calculations show that it is in fact energetically unfavorable for NbN to form in this cubic structure, and its predicted theoretical lattice constant is significantly smaller than the experimental value. Various approaches to the identification of an alternative structure are discussed. In preliminary investigations, we have found two new structures that are energetically more favorable than the NbO structure.	0	0	0

Power-law, de Sitter and intermediate inflationary universes emerge as special cases together with several new varieties of inflation. Analysing the behaviour of these models at the extrema of $\phi$ we derive sufficient constraints on the $m$ - $n$ parameter space such that inflation may occur as both an early and late-time phenomenon.

cond-mat/9501094	On the Renormalization of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation	The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation of nonlinear stochastic growth in d dimensions is studied using the mapping onto a system of directed polymers in a quenched random medium. The polymer problem is renormalized exactly in a minimally subtracted perturbation expansion about d = 2. For the KPZ roughening transition in dimensions d > 2, this renormalization group yields the dynamic exponent z* = 2 and the roughness exponent chi* = 0, which are exact to all orders in epsilon = (2 - d)/2. The expansion becomes singular in d = 4, which is hence identified with the upper critical dimension of the KPZ equation. The implications of this perturbation theory for the strong-coupling phase are discussed. In particular, it is shown that the correlation functions and the coupling constant defined in minimal subtraction develop an essential singularity at the strong-coupling fixed point.	1	2	2

A velocity dependent action ($S \propto \int dt \mid \vec{v} \mid^{\alpha}$) in the path integral (e.g. electrons moving in solids, or Brueckner's theory of nuclear matter) yields $d_{H}=\frac{\alpha }{\alpha - 1}$ if $\alpha > 2$ and $d_{H}=2$ if $\alpha \leq 2$. We discuss the relevance of fractal pathes in solid state physics and in $QFT$, in particular for the Wilson loop in $QCD$.	0	6	1

In order to place this work in context we also review the photon-hadron coupling within the framework of vector meson dominance.

Explicit analyses for the lambda phi^4 theory are performed in d=4 Euclidean space for both low and high temperature limits. We generate a set of coupled equations for the mass parameter and the coupling constant from the renormalization group flow equation.

astro-ph/9508054	A Survey of Near Infrared Emission in Visual Reflection Nebulae	We present a survey for extended 2.2 $\mu$m emission in 20 new visual reflection nebulae, illuminated by stars with temperatures of 3,600 --- 33,000 K. We detect extended 2.2 $\mu$m emission in 13 new nebulae, illuminated by stars with temperatures of 6,800 -- 33,000 K. For most of these 13 nebulae we have measured $J-K$, $H-K$, and $K-L'$, as well as obtaining surface brightness measurements at the wavelength of the 3.3 $\mu$m emission feature. All of the reflection nebulae with extended near infrared emission in excess over scattered starlight have very similar near infrared colors and show the 3.3 $\mu$m feature in emission with similar feature-to-continuum ratios. The 3.3 $\mu$m feature-to-continuum ratio ranges from $\sim$3 to $\sim$9, both within individual nebulae and from nebula to nebula, which suggests that the 3.3 $\mu$m feature and its underlying continuum arise from different materials, or from different ranges of sizes within a size distribution of particles. No dependence on the temperature of the illuminating star is seen in the near infrared colors or 3.3 $\mu$m feature-to-continuum ratio, over a factor of two in stellar temperature. This is similar to our previous IRAS results, in which we found no dependence of the ratio of 12 $\mu$m to 100 $\mu$m surface brightnesses in reflection nebulae illuminated by stars with temperatures of 5,000--33,000 K.	0	0	0

The model, which combines vector meson dominance at low Q**2 with diffractive Pomeron exchange for large Q**2, agrees with the observed small, but non-zero, slopes in log Q**2, which indicate the importance of higher twist shadowing effects in the transition region, 0.1 < Q**2 < 1 GeV**2.

We see how some relationships can be derived from others. The cases of N=2 supersymmetry in nine dimensions and N=4 supersymmetry in four dimensions are discussed in some detail. The latter case leads to consideration of quotients of a K3 surface times a torus and to a possible peculiar relationship between eleven-dimensional supergravity and the heterotic strings in ten dimensions.

It is shown explicitly how the two lines have in fact converged to a meeting point at which the precise mathematical conditions for the definition of the zeta function and the associated determinant are easy to understand from the considerations coming up from the physical approach, which proceeds by stepwise generalization starting from the most simple cases of physical interest. An explicit formula that establishes the bridge between the two approaches is obtained.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9506076	Acceleration Rates and Injection Efficiencies in Oblique Shocks	The rate at which particles are accelerated by the first-order Fermi mechanism in shocks depends on the angle, \teq{\Tbone}, that the upstream magnetic field makes with the shock normal. The greater the obliquity the greater the rate, and in quasi-perpendicular shocks rates can be hundreds of times higher than those seen in parallel shocks. In many circumstances pertaining to evolving shocks (\eg, supernova blast waves and interplanetary traveling shocks), high acceleration rates imply high maximum particle energies and obliquity effects may have important astrophysical consequences. However, as is demonstrated here, the efficiency for injecting thermal particles into the acceleration mechanism also depends strongly on obliquity and, in general, varies inversely with \teq{\Tbone}. The degree of turbulence and the resulting cross-field diffusion strongly influences both injection efficiency and acceleration rates. The test particle \mc simulation of shock acceleration used here assumes large-angle scattering, computes particle orbits exactly in shocked, laminar, non-relativistic flows, and calculates the injection efficiency as a function of obliquity, Mach number, and degree of turbulence. We find that turbulence must be quite strong for high Mach number, highly oblique shocks to inject significant numbers of thermal particles and that only modest gains in acceleration rates can be expected for strong oblique shocks over parallel ones if the only source of seed particles is the thermal background.	0	73	71

This approach enables us to translate any Japanese newspaper article into English, with quality far better than a word-for-word translation. Novel ideas include the use of feature structures to encode word lattices and the use of unification to compose and manipulate lattices. Unification also allows us to specify abstract features that delay target-language synthesis until enough source-language information is assembled.

cmp-lg/9506018	Intelligent Voice Prosthesis: Converting Icons into Natural Language Sentences	The Intelligent Voice Prosthesis is a communication tool which reconstructs the meaning of an ill-structured sequence of icons or symbols, and expresses this meaning into sentences of a Natural Language (French). It has been developed for the use of people who cannot express themselves orally in natural language, and further, who are not able to comply to grammatical rules such as those of natural language. We describe how available corpora of iconic communication by children with Cerebral Palsy has led us to implement a simple and relevant semantic description of the symbol lexicon. We then show how a unification-based, bottom-up semantic analysis allows the system to uncover the meaning of the user's utterances by computing proper dependencies between the symbols. The result of the analysis is then passed to a lexicalization module which chooses the right words of natural language to use, and builds a linguistic semantic network. This semantic network is then generated into French sentences via hierarchization into trees, using a lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar. Finally we describe the modular, customizable interface which has been developed for this system.	0	1	1

In particular we address the decay mode $B_c{\rightarrow}J/\psi \pi$ followed by the leptonic decay $J/\psi{\rightarrow}\mu^+\mu^-$, which should permit an accurate measurement of the $B_c$ mass.

In each case the lower dimensional theory is a Maxwell/Einstein supergravity theory. We find evidence for an equivalence, in certain cases, with heterotic string compactifications from D=10 to D=5,4,3, on compact manifolds of holonomy $SU(2)$ ($K_3\times S^1$), $SU(3)$, and $G_2$, respectively.

The correlation of these produced particles was analyzed with respect to the reaction plane. Lambda baryons exhibit a very pronounced sideward flow pattern which is qualitatively similar to the proton flow. However, the kaon ($K^+$,$K^0_S$) flow patterns are significantly different from that of the protons, and their form may be useful to restrict theoretical models on the form of the kaon potential in the nuclear medium.	0	75	25
quant-ph/9506005	Mechanical Effects of Radiation Pressure Quantum Fluctuations	As revealed by space-time probing, mechanics and field theory come out as complementary descriptions for motions in space-time. In particular, quantum fields exert a radiation pressure on scatterers which results in mechanical effects that persist in vacuum. They include mean forces due to quantum field fluctuations, like Casimir forces, but also fluctuations of these forces and additional forces linked to motion. As in classical electron theory, a moving scatterer is submitted to a radiation reaction force which modifies its motional response to an applied force. We briefly survey the mechanical effects of quantum field fluctuations and discuss the consequences for stability of motion in vacuum and for position fluctuations.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9511052	The ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey. II. The Distribution of Velocity Dispersions of Rich Galaxy Clusters	Summary - By combining the 5634 redshifts from the ESO Nearby Abell Cluster Survey (the ENACS) with another 1000 redshifts from the literature we are able to study the distribution of velocity dispersions for a volume-limited sample of 128 $R_{\rm ACO} \geq 1$ clusters, out to a redshift $z=0.1$, in a solid angle of 2.55 sr centered on the South Galactic Pole. In deriving velocity dispersions we apply a new, physically motivated method for removing fore- and background galaxies. We discuss in detail the completeness of the cluster sample for which we derive the distribution of cluster velocity dispersions. The large apparent spread between velocity dispersion and richness must be largely intrinsic. A consequence of the very broad relation between richness and velocity dispersion is that all cluster samples complete in richness are biased against low dispersions. For the richness limit of our sample this bias operates below about 800 km/sec. Above 800 km/s, our distribution of global velocity dispersions is free from systematic errors and biases, and agrees very well with the most recent determination of the distribution of cluster X-ray temperatures. Therefore, we conclude that X-ray temperature and velocity dispersion distributions statistically measure the same cluster property. We stress the need for model predictions that produce exactly the same information as provided by the observations, for a sample of model clusters with a richness limit that mimics that of the sample of observed clusters.	0	91	91

In particular, we derive an expression for the two-point density autocorrelation function of the network, which includes the internal structure of a cluster and the effective cluster-cluster pair distribution function. This formula can be applied to obtain information about nontrivial correlations in fibre networks.	1	3	3
gr-qc/9511062	Effect of gravitational radiation reaction on nonequatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole	The effect of gravitational radiation reaction on orbits around a spinning black hole is analyzed. Such orbits possess three constants of motion: $\iota$, $e$, and $a$, which correspond, in the Newtonian limit of the orbit being an ellipse, to the inclination angle of the orbital plane to the hole's equatorial plane, the eccentricity, and the semi-major axis length, respectively. First, it is argued that circular orbits ($e=0$) remain circular under gravitational radiation reaction. Second, for elliptical orbits (removing the restriction of $e=0$), the evolution of $\iota$, $e$, and $a$ is computed to leading order in $S$ (the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of the hole) and in $M/a$, where $M$ is the mass of the black hole. As $a$ decreases, $\iota$ increases and $e$ decreases.	0	55	48

The inclusive decay distributions (computed using an operator product expansion) depend on quark masses, and the exclusive decay distributions depend on hadron masses. Nevertheless, we show explicitly how the first two terms in the 1/m expansion match between the inclusive and exclusive decays. Agreement between the inclusive and exclusive decay rates requires a minimum smearing region of size Lambda_QCD before local duality holds in QCD. The alpha_s corrections to the inclusive and exclusive decay rates are also shown to agree to order (log m)/m^2. The alpha_s/m^2 corrections are used to obtain the alpha_s correction to Bjorken's inequality on the slope of the Isgur-Wise function.	0	44	43

Before attributing this to new physics effects, we investigate whether these high-$p_t$ jets can be explained by a modified gluon distribution inside the proton. We find enough flexibility in a global QCD analysis including the CDF inclusive jet data to provide a 25-35\% increase in the jet cross sections at the highest $p_t$ of the experiment. Two possible sets of parton distributions are presented, and the effects of these on other existing data sets are presented.

hep-ph/9511454	Phenomenology of the $1/m_Q$ Expansion in Inclusive $B$ and $D$ Meson Decays	We apply a recent theoretical analysis of hadronic observables in inclusive semileptonic heavy hadron decays to the phenomenology of $B$ and $D$ mesons. Correlated bounds on the nonperturbative parameters $\bar\Lambda$ and $\lambda_1$ are derived by considering data from $B$ decays and, independently, data from $D$ decays. The two sets of bounds are found to be consistent with each other. The data from $B$ decays are then are used to extract a lower limit on the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$. We address the issue of the convergence of the perturbative expansions used in the analysis, and compare our bounds on $\bar\Lambda$ and $\lambda_1$ to lattice and QCD sum rule results. Finally, we argue that a comparison of the analyses of $D$ and $D_s$ decays provides evidence for the applicability of parton-hadron duality in the semileptonic decay of charmed hadrons.	0	85	74

As we lower the temperature, new closed paths appear, including tunneling paths. The transition from single to multiple-path regime corresponds to well-defined catastrophes.

The extensions are most likely host galaxies, with luminosities of at least $3-7$\% of the QSO luminosity. The most likely values for the luminosities lie in the range $6-18$\% of the QSO luminosity ($R \sim 19.8-20.9$~mag). Our observations show that, if the extensions we have detected are indeed galaxies, extraordinary massive and luminous galaxies are not only characteristic of radio-loud objects, but of QSOs as an entire class.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9509115	A Lower Limit on the Age of the Universe	We report the results of a detailed numerical study designed to estimate both the absolute age and the uncertainty in age (with confidence limits) of the oldest globular clusters. Such an estimate is essential if a comparison with the Hubble age of the universe is to be made to determine the consistency, or lack thereof, of various cosmological models. Utilizing estimates of the uncertainty range (and distribution) in the input parameters of stellar evolution codes we produced 1000 Monte Carlo realizations of stellar isochrones, with which we could fit the ages of the 18 oldest globular clusters. Incorporating the observational uncertainties in the measured color-magnitude diagrams for these systems and the predicted isochrones, we derived a probability distribution for the mean age of these systems. The one-sided 95$\%$ C.L.~ lower bound for this distribution occurs at an age of 12.07 Gyr. This puts interesting constraints on cosmology which we discuss. Further details, including a description of the distributions, covariance matrices, dependence upon individual input parameters, etc.\ will appear in a future article.	0	68	60
astro-ph/9509139	Models of Quiescent Black Hole Neutron Star Soft X-Ray Transients	When the mass accretion rate onto a black hole (BH) falls below a critical rate, ${\dot M}_{crit}\sim \alpha^2 {\dot M}_{Edd}$, accretion can occur via a hot optically thin flow where most of the dissipated energy is advected inward. We present such an advection-dominated model for the soft X-ray transient (SXT) A0620-00. This source has a puzzlingly low X-ray luminosity in quiescence, $\sim 6\times 10^{30} ~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, despite a relatively high mass accretion rate $\sim10^{-10} ~M_{\odot}{\rm yr^{-1}}$ deduced from its optical flux. The accreting gas makes a transition from a standard thin disc at large radii to an advection-dominated flow at small radii. The transition occurs when the effective temperature of the thin disc is $\sim 10^4$ K. Because of the very low accretion efficiency, $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}$, in the inner flow, the model fits both the optical and X-ray data. We also present models for V404 Cyg and Nova Mus 1991 in quiescence. Quiescent neutron star (NS) transients are expected to appear very different from BH systems because the advected energy is re-radiated from the NS surface whereas a BH swallows the advected energy. We discuss models for NS SXTs.	0	2	2

Scaling exponents of the scalar field are analytically found to be $\zeta_{2n}=n\zeta_2-2(2-\zeta_2)n(n-1)/d$, while those of the dissipation field are $\mu_{n}=-2(2-\zeta_2)n(n-1)/d$ for orders $n\ll d$. The refined similarity hypothesis $\zeta_{2n}=n\zeta_2+\mu_{n}$ is thus established by a straightforward calculation for the case considered.	0	8	6
cond-mat/9509052	Geometric approach to the phenomenological theory of phase transitions of the second kind	Geometrical approach to the phenomenological theory of phase transitions of the second kind at constant pressure $P$ and variable temperature $T$ is proposed. Equilibrium states of a system at zero external field and fixed $P$ and $T$ are described by points in three-dimensional space with coordinates $\eta$, the order parameter, $T$, the temperature and $\phi$, the thermodynamic potential. These points form the so-called zero field curve in the $(\eta, T, \phi)$ space. Its branch point coincides with the critical point of the system. The small parameter of the theory is the distance from the critical point along the zero-field curve. It is emphasized that no explicit functional dependency of $\phi$ on $\eta$ and $T$ is imposed. It is shown that using $(\eta, T, \phi)$ space one cannot overcome well-known difficulties of the Landau theory of phase transitions and describe non-analytical behavior of real systems in the vicinity of the critical point. This becomes possible only if one increases the dimensionality of the space, taking into account the dependency of the thermodynamic potential not only on $\eta$ and $T$, but also on near (local) order parameters $\lambda_{i}$. In this case under certain conditions it is possible to describe anomalous increase of the specific heat when the temperature of the system approaches the critical point from above as well as from below the critical temperature $T_{c}$.	1	0	0

For $x=y$ (the case of interest when doing one-loop calculations) numerous approaches have been employed to determine this expansion to very high order; when $x \neq y$ (relevant for doing calculations beyond one-loop) there appear to be but two examples of performing the DeWitt expansion. In this paper we compute the off-diagonal elements of the DeWitt expansion coefficients using the Fock-Schwinger gauge. Our technique is based on representing $M_{xy}$ by a quantum mechanical path integral. We also generalize our method to the case of curved space, allowing us to determine the DeWitt expansion of $\tilde M_{xy} = \langle x| \exp \case{1}{2} [\case{1}{\sqrt {g}} (\partial_\mu - i A_\mu)g^{\mu\nu}{\sqrt{g}}(\partial_\nu - i A_\nu) ] t| y \rangle$ by use of normal coordinates. By comparison with results for the DeWitt expansion of this matrix element obtained by the iterative solution of the diffusion equation, the relative merit of different approaches to the representation of $\tilde M_{xy}$ as a quantum mechanical path integral can be assessed. Furthermore, the exact dependence of $\tilde M_{xy}$ on some geometric scalars can be determined. In two appendices, we discuss boundary effects in the one-dimensional quantum mechanical path integral, and the curved space generalization of the Fock-Schwinger gauge.	0	9	8

The specific structure of these algebras, allows us to construct realizations modulo null fields of the $W_3$ algebra that lies in the cosets $W(sl(4),sl(3))/u(1)$ and $W(sl(3|1),sl(3))/u(1)$. Such realizations exist for the following values of the $W_3$ algebra central charge: $c_W=-30,-40/7,-98/5,-2$. The first two values are listed for the first time, whereas for the remaining values we get the new realizations in terms of an arbitrary stress tensor and $u(1)\times sl(2)$ affine currents.	0	5	5
hep-th/9509075	Covariant approximation schemes for calculation of the heat kernel in quantum field theory	This paper is an overview on our recent results in the calculation of the heat kernel in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. We introduce a deformation of the background fields (including the metric of a curved spacetime manifold) and study various asymptotic expansions of the heat kernel diagonal associated with this deformation. Especial attention is payed to the low-energy approximation corresponding to the strong slowly varying background fields. We develop a new covariant purely algebraic approach for calculating the heat kernel diagonal in low-energy approximation by taking into account a finite number of low-order covariant derivatives of the background fields, and neglecting all covariant derivatives of higher orders. Then there exist a set of covariant differential operators that together with the background fields and their low-order derivatives generate a finite dimensional Lie algebra. In the zeroth order of the low-energy perturbation theory, determined by covariantly constant background, we use this algebraic structure to present the heat operator in the form of an average over the corresponding Lie group. This simplifies considerably the calculations and allows to obtain closed explicitly covariant formulas for the heat kernel diagonal. These formulas serve as the generating functions for the whole sequence of the Hadamard-Minakshisundaram- De Witt-Seeley coefficients in the low-energy approximation.	0	4	4
mtrl-th/9509006	First-principles investigation of 180-degree domain walls in BaTiO_3	We present a first-principles study of 180-degree ferroelectric domain walls in tetragonal barium titanate. The theory is based on an effective Hamiltonian that has previously been determined from first-principles ultrasoft-pseudopotential calculations. Statistical properties are investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. We compute the domain-wall energy, free energy, and thickness, analyze the behavior of the ferroelectric order parameter in the interior of the domain wall, and study its spatial fluctuations. An abrupt reversal of the polarization is found, unlike the gradual rotation typical of the ferromagnetic case.	0	2	0

Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to describe the interacting quark-meson system, we derive the effective equation of motion for the nucleon, as well as the self-consistent equations for the meson mean fields. The model is first applied to nuclear matter, after which we show some initial results for finite nuclei.	0	181	147
hep-ph/9501348	On The Effect of Binding in Deep Inelastic Scattering	The phenomenon of scaling in deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering is usually explained in terms of the Feynman parton model, and the logarithmic corrections to scaling are explained in the framework of perturbative QCD. For testing the validity of the parton model, we consider the deep inelastic electron scattering in a model in which the system electromagnetic current operator explicitly satisfies relativistic invariance and current conservation. Let the struck particle have the fraction $\xi$ of the total momentum in the infinite momentum frame. Then it is shown that, due to binding of particles in the system under consideration, the Bjorken variable $x$ no longer can be interpreted as $\xi$, even in the Bjorken limit and in zero order of the perturbation theory. We argue that, as a result, the data on deep inelastic scattering alone do not make it possible to determine the $\xi$ distribution of quarks in the nucleon.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9509111	A study on the nature of the peculiar supergiant HD101584	We present a study of low- and high-resolution ultraviolet, high-resolution optical CAT/CES spectra and ultraviolet, optical and infrared photometry of the peculiar supergiant HD101584. From the photometry we learn that the ultraviolet and optical energy distribution cannot be fitted in a consistent way and we need a model in which the UV and optical energy distribution are formed by different gas. The Geneva photometry is best fitted to a B9II Kurucz model, Teff=12000+-1000K and log g=3.0 +-1.0, with an extinction of E(B-V)=0.49+-0.05. The observed spectral features in the spectrum of HD101584 are classified in eight different categories based on the velocity, shape of profile and the identification. The high-excitation HeI(chi=20.87eV), NII(chi=18.40eV), CII (chi=14.39eV) and NI (chi=10.29eV) optical absorption lines are formed in the photosphere of a late B-star (e.g. B8-9I-II). These absorption lines show radial velocity variations which are attributed to binary motion, with the secondary being a white dwarf or a low-mass main sequence object. The low-excitation P-Cygni lines in the optical and UV are formed in the wind. The number density of absorption lines in the UV is so large that the wind spectrum acts as an iron curtain in front of the B-star. The terminal velocity of the wind of $v_{\infty}=100\pm30$ km~s$^{-1}~$ is consistent with the star being a low-mass post-AGB star and the low effective gravity is attributed to the presence of a nearby, unseen, secondary. We estimate a mass-loss rate of \.{M}$\approx 10^{-8}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. Narrow absorption and emission lines are observed which are formed in a circumsystem disk with a typical radius of $10^{2} R_{\ast}$.	0	0	0
cond-mat/9512095	Spatial structure of anomalously localized states in disordered conductors	The spatial structure of wave functions of anomalously localized states (ALS) in disordered conductors is studied in the framework of the $\sigma$--model approach. These states are responsible for slowly decaying tails of various distribution functions. In the quasi-one-dimensional case, properties of ALS governing the asymptotic form of the distribution of eigenfunction amplitudes are investigated with the use of the transfer matrix method, which yields an exact solution to the problem. Comparison of the results with those obtained in the saddle-point approximation to the problem shows that the saddle-point configuration correctly describes the smoothed intensity of an ALS. On this basis, the properties of ALS in higher spatial dimensions are considered. We study also the ALS responsible for the asymptotic behavior of distribution functions of other quantities, such as relaxation time, local and global density of state. It is found that the structure of an ALS may be different, depending on the specific quantity, for which it constitutes an optimal fluctuation. Relations between various procedures of selection of ALS, and between asymptotics of corresponding distribution functions, are discussed.	1	3	3
cond-mat/9512117	Big bang simulation in superfluid 3He-B -- Vortex nucleation in neutron-irradiated superflow	We report the observation of vortex formation upon the absorption of a thermal neutron in a rotating container of superfluid $^3$He-B. The nuclear reaction n + $^3$He = p + $^3$H + 0.76MeV heats a cigar shaped region of the superfluid into the normal phase. The subsequent cooling of this region back through the superfluid transition results in the nucleation of quantized vortices. Depending on the superflow velocity, sufficiently large vortex rings grow under the influence of the Magnus force and escape into the container volume where they are detected individually with nuclear magnetic resonance. The larger the superflow velocity the smaller the rings which can expand. Thus it is possible to obtain information about the morphology of the initial defect network. We suggest that the nucleation of vortices during the rapid cool-down into the superfluid phase is similar to the formation of defects during cosmological phase transitions in the early universe.	1	229	153
gr-qc/9512035	Quantum-conformal Field theory	A theoretical study is made of conformal factors in certain types of physical theories based on classical differential geometry. Analysis of quantum versions of Weyl's theory suggest that similar field equations should be available in four, five and more dimensions. Various conformal factors are associated with the wave functions of source and test particles. This allows for quantum field equations to be developed. The curvature tensors are calculated and separated into gravitational, electromagnetic and quantum components. Both four and five dimensional covariant theories are studied. Nullity of the invariant five scalar of curvature leads to the Klein-Gordon equation. The mass is associated with an eigenvalue of the differential operator of the fifth dimension. Different concepts of interaction are possible and may apply in a quantum gravitational theory.	0	1	0
hep-ph/9512310	A new possibility to monitor collisions of relativistic heavy ions at LHC and RHIC	We consider the radiation of particles of one bunch in the collective field of the oncoming bunch, called coherent bremsstrahlung (CBS). The main characteristics of CBS for LHC (in the Pb-Pb mode) and for RHIC are calculated. At LHC about $3.9 10^8 dE_\gamma/E_\gamma$ photons per second are expected for photon energies $E_\gamma \stackrel{<} {\sim} E_c= 93 $ eV. It seems that CBS can be a potential tool for optimizing collisions and for measuring beam parameters. The bunch length can be found from the critical energy of the CBS spectrum; the transverse bunch size is related to the photon rate. A specific dependence of photon rate on the impact parameter between the beams allows for a fast control over the beam displacement.	0	1	0
hep-ph/9512385	Dynamical Higgs Mechanism without Elementary Scalars: A Lesson from Instantons	The generation of gauge--dependent fermion vacuum condensates in Yang--Mills theory would dynamically break the gauge symmetry and thus provide an alternative to the Higgs mechanism in unified theories. We explore a simple example: instanton-induced quark pair (diquark) condensation in QCD with 2 flavors and $N_c$ colors. We do find diquark condensates in the vacuum, but only for $N_c = 2$, where they are equivalent to the standard quark-antiquark condensate. At $N_c \geq 3$ diquark condensates exist as meta--stable saddle points of the instanton-induced effective QCD action and may strongly affect the properties of matter under extreme conditions. The scalar diquark excitation, which is a Goldstone boson at $N_c =2$, becomes unbound for $N_c \geq 3$.	0	32	23

The analysis shows the lightest neutralino is the LSP over most of the parameter space of the supergravity model. The event rates in neutralino- nucleus scattering in dark matter detectors are also discussed.It is found that the event rates are sensititive to the constraint from the $b\rightarrow s\gamma$ experiment.It is also found that the event rates are sensitive to the constraints of relic density and in our analysis we have used the accurate method for the computation of the neutralino relic density. Finally,the effect of the new results on quark polarizabilities, from the data of the Spin Muon Collaboration, on event rates is also discussed.The analysis shows that the event rates for the Ge detectors and for other detectors which use heavy targets are only negligibly affected.	0	0	0

A new maximum likelihood method of calibration is applied to derive the PL relation for a composite sample of Cepheids in the LMC and in the SNIa host galaxies NGC5253 and IC4182. Our results show that the calibration of the Cepheid PL relation is robust both to sampling error and to luminosity and period selection effects. Hence, the outstanding uncertainty in deriving estimates of $H_0$ from SNIa remains the dispersion of the SNIa luminosity function, and not unresolved systematic errors in its Cepheid calibration.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9603079	Comment on a Paper by Fang, Huang, and Wu	Before decoupling in the early universe, the tightly coupled photon/electron gas underwent acoustic oscillations. These oscillations should be visible today in the spectrum of anisotropies. Recently Fang, Huang, and Wu (1996) claimed that when random processes are accounted for, the phases of these oscillations are no longer coherent. In fact, they claim that the well-defined peaks will be completely smoothed out. We show here that their claim is incorrect. The standard Boltzmann treatment determining the anisotropies is sufficient; random processes do not change the standard result.	0	0	0

cond-mat/9603087	Fluid Induced Particle Size Segregation in Sheared Granular Assemblies	We perform a two-dimensional molecular-dynamics study of a model for sheared bidisperse granular systems under conditions of simple shear and Poiseuille flow. We propose a mechanism for particle-size segregation based on the observation that segregation occurs if the viscous length scale introduced by a liquid in the system is smaller than of the order of the particle size. We show that the ratio of shear rate to viscosity must be small if one wants to find size segregation. In this case the particles in the system arrange themselves in bands of big and small particles oriented along the direction of the flow. Similarly, in Poiseuille flow we find the formation of particle bands. Here, in addition, the variety of time scales in the flow leads to an aggregation of particles in the zones of low shear rate and can suppress size segregation in these regions. The results have been verified against simulations using a full Navier-Stokes description for the liquid.	1	0	0

We also consider the dissipative effects of produced particles and find that the dissipation reduces the resonant decay rate of inflaton field.	0	21	17

It is shown how to construct a matrix element that correctly treats width effects for the intermediate unstable $W$ boson and that is both $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_{\rm e.m.}$ gauge-invariant. $SU(2)_L$ gauge-invariance is maintained by Laurent expansion in kinematic invariants and $U(1)_{\rm e.m.}$ gauge-invariance is enforced by means of a projection operator under which the exact matrix element is invariant.	0	7	7

Especially the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor $\langle T_{ab}\rangle$, observed by a freely falling observer, is computed.

The Lagrangian is derived using an adapted superspace including, in addition to a scalar field, two fields with spins 1/3,2/3. This theory turns out to be a rational conformal field theory. The symmetry of this model goes beyond the super Virasoro algebra and connects these third-integer spin states. Besides the stress-momentum tensor, we obtain a supercurrent of spin 4/3. Cubic relations are involved in order to close the algebra; the basic algebra is no longer a Lie or a super-Lie algebra. The central charge of this model is found to be 5/3. Finally, we analyse the form that a local invariant action should take.	0	30	23
hep-th/9603151	The Gauged Thirring Model	We propose the gauged Thirring model as a natural gauge-invariant generalization of the Thirring model, four-fermion interaction of current-current type. In the strong gauge-coupling limit, the gauged Thirring model reduces to the recently proposed reformulation of the Thirring model as a gauge theory. Especially, we pay attention to the effect coming from the kinetic term for the gauge boson field, which was originally the auxiliary field without the kinetic term. In 3 + 1 dimensions, we find the nontrivial phase structure for the gauged Thirring model, based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator as well as the gauge-invariant effective potential for the chiral order parameter. Within this approximation, we study the renormalization group flows (lines of constant physics) and find a signal for nontrivial continuum limit with nonvanishing renormalized coupling constant and large anomalous dimension for the gauged Thirring model in 3+1 dimensions, at least for small number of flavors $N_f$. Finally we discuss the (perturbatively) renormalizable extension of the gauged Thirring model.	0	12	10

astro-ph/9602079	Chaos and Mixing in Triaxial Stellar Systems	We investigate the timescales for stochasticity and chaotic mixing in a family of triaxial potentials that mimic the distribution of light in elliptical galaxies. Some of the models include central point masses designed to represent nuclear black holes. Most of the boxlike orbits are found to be stochastic, with mean Liapunov times that are 3-6 times the period of the long-axis orbit. In models with large cores or small black holes, the stochastic orbits mimic regular box orbits for hundreds of oscillations at least. However a small core radius or significant black hole mass causes most of the stochastic orbits to diffuse through phase space on the same timescale, visiting a significant fraction of the volume beneath the equipotential surface. We estimate timescales for chaotic mixing in the more strongly stochastic models by evolving ensembles of 10^4 points until their distribution reaches a nearly steady state. Mixing initially takes place rapidly, with characteristic times of 10-30 dynamical times, as the phase points fill a region similar in shape to that of a box orbit. Subsequent mixing is slower, with characteristic times of hundreds of orbital times. Mixing rates were found to be enhanced by the addition of modest force perturbations. The consequences for the structure and evolution of elliptical galaxies are discussed.	0	3	3
astro-ph/9602107	Gravitational waves from pulsars: emission by the magnetic field induced distortion	The gravitational wave emission by a distorted rotating fluid star is computed. The distortion is supposed to be symmetric around some axis inclined with respect to the rotation axis. In the general case, the gravitational radiation is emitted at two frequencies: $\Omega$ and $2\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the rotation frequency. The obtained formul\ae\ are applied to the specific case of a neutron star distorted by its own magnetic field. Assuming that the period derivative $\dot P$ of pulsars is a measure of their magnetic dipole moment, the gravitational wave amplitude can be related to the observable parameters $P$ and $\dot P$ and to a factor $\beta$ which measures the efficiency of a given magnetic dipole moment in distorting the star. $\beta$ depends on the nuclear matter equation of state and on the magnetic field distribution. The amplitude at the frequency $2\Omega$, expressed in terms of $P$, $\dot P$ and $\beta$, is independent of the angle $\alpha$ between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis, whereas at the frequency $\Omega$, the amplitude increases as $\alpha$ decreases. The value of $\beta$ for specific models of magnetic field distributions has been computed by means of a numerical code giving self-consistent models of magnetized neutron stars within general relativity. It is found that the distortion at fixed magnetic dipole moment is very dependent of the magnetic field distribution; a stochastic magnetic field or a superconductor stellar interior greatly increases $\beta$ with respect to the uniformly magnetized perfect conductor case and might lead to gravitational waves detectable by the VIRGO or LIGO interferometers. The amplitude modulation of the signal induced by the daily rotation of the Earth has been computed and specified to the case of the Crab pulsar and VIRGO	0	115	81

The charge density wave period has been optimized and was found to be $\simeq 3R_c$, where $R_c$ is the cyclotron radius. We conclude that the optimal charge density wave is more energetically preferable than the Laughlin liquid for the Landau level numbers $N \ge 2$ at $\nu_N = 1/3$ and for $N \ge 3$ at $\nu_N = 1/5$. This implies that the $1/3$ fractional quantum Hall effect cannot be observed for $N \ge 2$, in agreement with the experiment.	1	0	0

cond-mat/9602162	Vortex statistics in a disordered two-dimensional XY model	The equilibrium behavior of vortices in the classical two-dimensional (2D) XY model with uncorrelated random phase shifts is investigated. The model describes Josephson-Junction arrays with positional disorder, and has ramifications in a number of other bond-disordered 2D systems. The vortex Hamiltonian is that of a Coulomb gas in a background of quenched random dipoles, which is capable of forming either a dielectric insulator or a plasma. We confirm a recent suggestion by Nattermann, Scheidl, Korshunov, and Li [J. Phys. I (France) {\bf 5}, 565 (1995)], and by Cha and Fertig [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 74}, 4867 (1995)] that, when the variance $\sigma$ of random phase shifts is smaller than a critical value $\sigma_c$, the system is in a phase with quasi-long-range order at low temperatures, without a reentrance transition. This conclusion is reached through a nearly exact calculation of the single-vortex free energy, and a Kosterlitz-type renormalization group analysis of screening and random polarization effects from vortex-antivortex pairs. The critical strength of disorder $\sigma_c$ is found not to be universal, but generally lies in the range $0<\sigma_c<\pi/8$. Argument is presented to suggest that the system at $\sigma>\sigma_c$ does not possess long-range glassy order at any finite temperature. In the ordered phase, vortex pairs undergo a series of spatial and angular localization processes as the temperature is lowered. This behavior, which is common to many glass-forming systems, can be quantified through approximate mappings to the random energy model and to the directed polymer on the Cayley tree. Various critical properties at the order-disorder transition are calculated.	1	5	5

astro-ph/9604003	Gamma-ray emission and spectral evolution of pair plasmas in AGN jets	The evolution of the particle distribution functions inside a relativistic jet containing an e^-e^+ pair plasma and of the resulting $\gamma$-ray and X-ray spectra is investigated. The first phase of this evolution is governed by heavy radiative energy losses. For this phase, approximative expressions for the energy-loss rates due to inverse-Compton scattering, using the full Klein-Nishina cross section, are given as one-dimensional integrals for both cooling by inverse-Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (SSC) and of accretion disk photons (EIC). We calculate instantaneous and time-integrated $\gamma$-ray spectra emitted by such a jet for various sets of parameters, deducing some general implications on the observable broadband radiation. Finally, we present model fits to the broadband spectrum of Mrk 421. We find that the most plausible way to explain both the quiescent and the flaring state of Mrk 421 consists of a model where EIC and SSC dominate the observed spectrum in different frequency bands. In our model the flaring state is primarily related to an increase of the maximum Lorentz factor of the injected pairs.	0	2	1
astro-ph/9604118	The nature of the faint galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field	We present a study of the galaxies found in the Hubble Deep Field. A high proportion of HDF galaxies are undergoing a strong episode of star formation, as evidenced by their very blue colours. A wide range of morphological types is found, with a high proportion of peculiar and merger morphologies. Fitting the multiband spectra with redshifted SEDs of galaxy types E to HII, we predict the spectral types and redshifts of galaxies detected in the HDF. We find a median redshift of 1.6, with $68\%$ having $z > 1$ and $31\%$ with $z >2$. The I-band absolute magnitude distributions as a function of galaxy types show a plausible trend of decreasing luminosity towards later types. The derived I-band luminosity function agrees well with that from the Canada-France survey (Lilly et al 1996) for $z < 1$ and shows strong luminosity evolution at $M_I < -21$ for $1 < z < 3$, comparable to the rate seen in quasars and starburst galaxies. We have predicted infrared and submillimetre fluxes assuming most of the galaxies are undergoing a strong starburst. Several planned space-borne and ground-based deep surveys are capable of detecting interesting numbers of HDF galaxies.	0	1	1
cmp-lg/9604023	A Model-Theoretic Framework for Theories of Syntax	A natural next step in the evolution of constraint-based grammar formalisms from rewriting formalisms is to abstract fully away from the details of the grammar mechanism---to express syntactic theories purely in terms of the properties of the class of structures they license. By focusing on the structural properties of languages rather than on mechanisms for generating or checking structures that exhibit those properties, this model-theoretic approach can offer simpler and significantly clearer expression of theories and can potentially provide a uniform formalization, allowing disparate theories to be compared on the basis of those properties. We discuss $\LKP$, a monadic second-order logical framework for such an approach to syntax that has the distinctive virtue of being superficially expressive---supporting direct statement of most linguistically significant syntactic properties---but having well-defined strong generative capacity---languages are definable in $\LKP$ iff they are strongly context-free.

These lectures (from the Les Houches School in October 1995) review the current status of this program, and discuss the methods by which data from different detectors can be used to make measurements of, or place limits on, a stochastic background. They also review possible cosmological sources and their potential detectability.	0	133	60
hep-ph/9604265	Supercompositeness Inspired From Superstrings	String Unified Models based on the $k=1$ level of the Kac-Moody Algebra, predict the existence of ``exotic'' new states which carry fractional electric charges. We analyse the possibility of considering these ``exotics'' as preonic matter which can be used to form the families and the gauge group breaking higgs scalars. It is proposed that such a formation may occur provided that these states transform non-trivially under a non-Abelian gauge group with a relatively large rank in order to confine them at a sufficiently large scale. Such a situation is natural in string derived unified models, since the role of the confining group can be played by (part of) the Hidden symmetry. As an example, we present a string derived toy model based on the $SU(4)\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ Pati-Salam gauge group.	0	4	3

astro-ph/9611026	High Carbon in I Zwicky 18: New Results from Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopy	We present new measurements of the gas-phase C/O abundance ratio in both the NW and SE components of the extremely metal-poor dwarf irregular galaxy I Zw 18, based on ultraviolet spectroscopy of the two H II regions using the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We determine values of log C/O = -0.63 +/- 0.10 for the NW component and log C/O = -0.56 +/- 0.09 for the SE component. In comparison, log C/O = -0.37 in the sun, while log C/O = -0.85 +/- 0.07 in the three most metal-poor irregular galaxies measured by Garnett et al. (1995a). Our measurements show that C/O in I Zw 18 is significantly higher than in other comparably metal-poor irregular galaxies, and above predictions for the expected C/O from massive star nucleosynthesis. These results suggest that carbon in I Zw 18 has been enhanced by an earlier population of lower-mass carbon producing stars; this idea is supported by stellar photometry of I Zw 18 and its companion, which demonstrate that the current bursts of massive stars were not the first. Despite its very low metallicity, it is likely that I Zw 18 is not a ``primeval'' galaxy.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9611096	Galactic Drips and How to Stop Them!	The temperature of hot interstellar gas at large radii in elliptical galaxies can be lower than the mean galactic virial temperature. If so, a nonlinear cooling wave can form in the hot interstellar gas and propagate slowly toward the galactic core. If the cooling wave survives hydrodynamic instabilities, it can intermittently deposit cold gas within about 15 effective radii. For a bright elliptical the total mass deposited in this manner can approach 10^10 solar masses. The cold gas that drips out at large galactic radii may account for the young stellar populations and extended gas at $\sim 10^4$ K observed in many ellipticals, features that are often attributed to galactic mergers. Galactic drips are expected in relatively isolated (field) ellipticals provided (i) the galactic stellar velocity ellipsoids are radially oriented at large galactic radii and (ii) the current Type Ia supernova rate is sufficiently small to be consistent with interstellar iron abundances found in recent X-ray studies. Galactic drips are surpressed in ellipticals located within clusters of galaxies; when the pressure in the ambient cluster gas exceeds that in the outer parts of the galactic interstellar medium, some cluster gas flows into the galaxy which surpresses the drips.	0	0	0

cond-mat/9611030	Carbon superatom thin films	Assembling clusters on surfaces has emerged as a novel way to grow thin films with targeted properties. In particular, it has been proposed from experimental findings that fullerenes deposited on surfaces could give rise to thin films retaining the bonding properties of the incident clusters. However the microscopic structure of such films is still unclear. By performing quantum molecular dynamics simulations, we show that C_28 fullerenes can be deposited on a surface to form a thin film of nearly defect free molecules, which act as carbon superatoms. Our findings help clarify the structure of disordered small fullerene films and also support the recently proposed hyperdiamond model for solid C_28.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9611133	Scaling of the quasiparticle spectrum for d-wave superconductors	In finite magnetic field H, the excitation spectrum of the low energy quasiparticles in a 2 dimensional d-wave superconductor exhibits a scaling with respect to $H^{1/2}$. This property can be used to calculate scaling relations for various physical quantities at low temperature T. As examples, we make predictions for the scaling behavior of the finite magnetic field specific heat, quasiparticle magnetic susceptibility, optical conductivity tensor, and thermal conductivity tensor. These predictions are compatible with existing experimental data. Most notably, the thermal Hall coefficient $\kappa_{xy}$ measured by Krishana et al. in YBCO is found to scale as $\kappa_{xy} \sim T^2 F(\alpha T/H^{1/2})$ for $T \lesssim 30 K$ in agreement with our predictions, where $\alpha$ is a constant and F is a scaling function.	1	2	1
gr-qc/9611038	Local and global gravity	Our long experience with Newtonian potentials has inured us to the view that gravity only produces local effects. In this paper we challenge this quite deeply ingrained notion and explicitly identify some intrinsically global gravitational effects. In particular we show that the global cosmological Hubble flow can actually modify the motions of stars and gas within individual galaxies, and even do so in a way which can apparently eliminate the need for galactic dark matter. Also we show that a classical light wave acquires an observable, global, path dependent phase in traversing a gravitational field. Both of these effects serve to underscore the intrinsic difference between non-relativistic and relativistic gravity.	0	12	6

This mechanism leads to the cross-sections which are independent of W^2 for the exchange of three non-interacting gluons or exhibit increase with increasing W^2 (or 1/x) for the odderon intercept above unity. The \eta_c electroproduction in the three gluon exchange mechanism is shown to be entirely controlled by the transversely polarised virtual photons. The magnitude of the eta_c photoproduction cross-section is estimated to be around 11-45pb. The t-dependence of the differential cross-section is also discussed.	0	41	37

physics/9611013	Origin of entropy convergence in hydrophobic hydration and protein folding	An information theory model is used to construct a molecular explanation why hydrophobic solvation entropies measured in calorimetry of protein unfolding converge at a common temperature. The entropy convergence follows from the weak temperature dependence of occupancy fluctuations for molecular-scale volumes in water. The macroscopic expression of the contrasting entropic behavior between water and common organic solvents is the relative temperature insensitivity of the water isothermal compressibility. The information theory model provides a quantitative description of small molecule hydration and predicts a negative entropy at convergence. Interpretations of entropic contributions to protein folding should account for this result.	0	0	0

Among others, unitary \reps corresponding to all classical one-particle representations with integral weights are found for $q = e^{i \pi /M}$, with $M$ being large enough. In the "massless" case with spin bigger than or equal to 1 in 4 dimensions, they are unitarizable only after factoring out a subspace of "pure gauges", as classically.

adap-org/9605002	Physical Complexity of Symbolic Sequences	A practical measure for the complexity of sequences of symbols (``strings'') is introduced that is rooted in automata theory but avoids the problems of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity. This physical complexity can be estimated for ensembles of sequences, for which it reverts to the difference between the maximal entropy of the ensemble and the actual entropy given the specific environment within which the sequence is to be interpreted. Thus, the physical complexity measures the amount of information about the environment that is coded in the sequence, and is conditional on such an environment. In practice, an estimate of the complexity of a string can be obtained by counting the number of loci per string that are fixed in the ensemble, while the volatile positions represent, again with respect to the environment, randomness. We apply this measure to tRNA sequence data.	0	23	0
astro-ph/9605010	A Procedure for Correcting the Apparent Optical Depths of Moderately Saturated Interstellar Absorption Lines	Most observations of absorption lines from interstellar and intergalactic matter have sufficient resolution to show most of the structure at differing radial velocities of the absorber. In analyzing the lines, however, it is important to sense and correct for the fact that some parts of a profile may have some very narrow structures that are saturated and then degraded by the convolution of the true spectrum by the instrumental profile. This can be done by comparing at each velocity the apparent optical depths of two lines that have significantly different transition probabilities. If their ratio is smaller than the ratio of the lines' values of f(lambda), the actual saturation is more severe than that indicated by the raw optical depths. This paper describes a simple procedure for selectively boosting apparent optical depth of the weaker of the two lines at each velocity value, so that unresolved saturated structure is accounted for, thus yielding a very nearly correct answer for the column density per unit velocity. Some test examples that demonstrate the use of the correction method are given, along with a simple recipe for invoking it.	0	51	51

We apply the theory to determine this correlation function for the case of the FCC solid phase of hard spheres. The agreement with simulation data is excellent over all the density range. The application to other simple systems is discussed. The approach opens a new route to perturbation theories for simple solids.	1	0	0

Low-lying degrees of freedom of the field theory are shown to reflect the irreversible classical dynamics describing relaxation of phase space distributions. The validity of this approach is investigated over a wide range of energy scales. As well as recovering the universal long-time behavior characteristic of random matrix ensembles, this approach accounts correctly for the short-time limit yielding results which agree with the diagonal approximation of periodic orbit theory.	1	64	35

The framework for dynamical symmetry breaking we assume is technicolor, with a walking coupling $\atc$, and extended technicolor. The reactions discussed occur mainly at subprocess energies $\rshat \simle 1\,\tev$. They include production of color-singlet and octet technirhos and their decay into pairs of technipions, longitudinal weak bosons, or jets. Technipions, in turn, decay predominantly into heavy fermions. Many of these signatures are also expected to occur in topcolor-assisted technicolor. Several particles specific to this new scenario are discussed. Additional signatures of flavor dynamics, associated with quark and lepton substructure, may be sought in excess production rates for high $E_T$ and invariant mass dijets and dileptons. An important feature of these processes is that they exhibit fairly central angular and rapidity distributions.	0	33	16

The method is especially suitable for such theories as it avoids the need for dimensional continuation of three-dimensional antisymmetric tensor and the Feynman rules for three-dimensional theories in coordinate space are relatively simple. The calculus involved is still lengthy but not as difficult as other existing methods of calculation. We compute one-loop propagators and vertices and derive the one-loop local effective action for topologically massive Yang-Mills theory. We then consider Chern-Simons field theory as the large mass limit of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and show that this leads to the famous shift in the parameter $k$.

It can be defined either in coordinate or momentum space, the latter being more flexible for treating tadpoles and diagrams where insertion of counterterms generates tadpoles. Within this version, gauge invariance is automatically preserved to all orders in Abelian case. Since differential renormalization is a strictly four-dimensional renormalization scheme it looks preferable for application in each situation when dimensional renormalization meets difficulties, especially, in theories with chiral and super symmetries. The calculation of the ABJ triangle anomaly is given as an example to demonstrate simplicity of calculations within the presented version of differential renormalization.	0	4	2

We discuss how this T-asymmetric property of black holes arises in the recently proposed (T-symmetric) microscopic models of black holes based on bound states of D-branes. In these string theory based models, the nonvanishing classical absorption is made possible essentially by the exponentially increasing degeneracy of quantum states with mass of the black hole. The classical limit of the absorption crosssection computed in the microscopic model agrees with the result obtained from a classical analysis of a wave propagating in the background metric of the corresponding black hole (upto a numerical factor).	0	159	153

We show that if a nonlinear tent map $f$ is not infinitely renormalizable, then all its periodic orbits of sufficiently high period are hyperbolic repelling. If additionally all periodic orbits of $f$ are hyperbolic, then $f$ has at most finitely many periodic attractors and there is a hyperbolic expansion outside the basins of these periodic attractors. In particular, if a nonlinear tent map $f$ is not infinitely renormalizable and all its periodic orbits are hyperbolic repelling, then some iterate of $f$ is expanding. In this case, $f$ admits an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure.	0	0	0

Using Lorentz invariance, gauge invariance, and crossing symmetry, we derive the leading terms of an expansion of the operator in the four-momenta $q$ and $q'$ of the initial and final photon, respectively. The model-independent result is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic form factors of the free nucleon, i.e., on-shell information which one obtains from electron-nucleon scattering experiments. Model-dependent terms appear in the operator at $O(q_\alpha q'_\beta)$, whereas the orders $O(q_\alpha q_\beta)$ and $O(q'_\alpha q'_\beta)$ are contained in the low-energy theorem for $\Gamma^{\mu\nu}$, i.e., no new parameters appear.

If the phase transition is first order, the sound speed vanishes during the transition, and density perturbations fall freely. This distorts the primordial Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum of density fluctuations below the Hubble scale at the transition. Peaks are produced, which grow at most linearly in wavenumber, both for the hadron-photon-lepton fluid and for cold dark matter.

First we show the ability of two independent Bose condensates to create an interference pattern, even if both condensates are described by Fock states. Thus, the existence of an experimental signature for a broken gauge symmetry, seen in a single run of the experiment, is not necessarily reflected by a broken symmetry on the level of the quantum mechanical state vector. Based on these results, we simulate numerically a recent experiment with two independent Bose condensates, performed by the group of W.Ketterle (MIT). The calculated expansion of the condensates is in good agreement with the experimental data. In addition the existence of interference fringes is predicted based on the nonlinear Schroedinger equation.

The analysis shows that for any assumed value for $\Omega$ (the total energy density) one can fix the value of $\Omega_{\rm bar}$ (the baryonic energy density) in such a way as to accommodate the observational constraints coming from the $^4{\rm He}$ primordial abundance. In particular, if we impose the inflationary value $\Omega=1$ the resulting baryonic energy density turns out to be $\Omega_{\rm bar}\sim 0.021$. This result lies in the very narrow range $0.016 \leq \Omega_{\rm bar} \leq 0.026$ allowed by the observed values of the primordial abundances of the other light elements. The remaining fraction of $\Omega$ corresponds to dark matter represented by a scalar field.	0	18	10

It is shown that in a wide range of values of the recoil the Isgur-Wise form factor exhibits a moderate dependence upon the choice of the heavy-meson wave function and is mainly governed by the effects of the confinement scale.	0	22	19

hep-ph/9601367	Experimental Signatures of Low Energy Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking	The experimental signatures for gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking are presented. The phenomenology associated with this class of models is distinctive since the gravitino is naturally the LSP. The next lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) can be a gaugino, Higgsino, or right handed slepton. Decay of the NLSP to its partner plus the LSP proceeds through the Goldstino component of the gravitino. For a significant range of parameters this decay can take place within the detector, and can be measured as a displaced vertex or kink in a charged particle track. In the case that the NLSP is mostly gaugino, we identify the discovery modes as $e^+e^- \rightarrow \gamma \gamma + \Emiss$, and $p \bar{p} \rightarrow l^+ l^- \gamma \gamma + \EmissT$. If the NLSP is a right handed slepton the discovery modes are $e^+ e^- \rightarrow l^+ l^- + \Emiss$ and $p \bar{p} \rightarrow l^+ l^- + \EmissT$. An NLSP which is mostly Higgsino is also considered. Finally, these theories can contain scalar particles which mediate sub-millimeter range coherent forces of gravitational strength.	0	277	219
math/9601213	Dynamical stability in Lagrangian systems	This paper surveys various results concerning stability for the dynamics of Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) systems on compact manifolds. The main, positive results state, roughly, that if the configuration manifold carries a hyperbolic metric, \ie a metric of constant negative curvature, then the dynamics of the geodesic flow persists in the Euler-Lagrange flows of a large class of time-periodic Lagrangian systems. This class contains all time-periodic mechanical systems on such manifolds. Many of the results on Lagrangian systems also hold for twist maps on the cotangent bundle of hyperbolic manifolds. We also present a new stability result for autonomous Lagrangian systems on the two torus which shows, among other things, that there are minimizers of all rotation directions. However, in contrast to the previously known \cite{hedlund} case of just a metric, the result allows the possibility of gaps in the speed spectrum of minimizers. Our negative result is an example of an autonomous mechanical Lagrangian system on the two-torus in which this gap actually occurs. The same system also gives us an example of a Euler-Lagrange minimizer which is not a Jacobi minimizer on its energy level.	0	0	0

We prove this conjecture for Seifert rational homology spheres. We also derive it for manifolds constructed by a surgery on a knot in S^3.

astro-ph/9607140	Detecting Neutrinos from AGN: New Fluxes and Cross Sections	New information on the structure of the nucleon from the HERA ep collider leads to higher neutrino cross sections for the processes nu_mu + N --> mu + X needed to calculate the expected rates of astrophysical neutrino induced muons in large detectors either under construction, or in the design stage. These higher cross sections lead to higher muon rates for arrival angles where neutrino attenuation in the earth is less important. On the other hand, new estimates of AGN neutrino fluxes suggest that the expected muon rates in these detectors may be much lower than previously calculated. I use the new cross sections to calculate the expected muon rates and angular distributions in large detectors for a variety of AGN models and compare these rates with the atmospheric neutrino backrounds (from both conventional decay channels and the "prompt" charmed meson decay channels). If the lowest flux estimates are correct, there may be diffculties in determining the origin of a small excess of muons, due to the large uncertainty in the rate of the charmed meson neutrino production channel. However, the more optimistic AGN neutrino fluxes should be detectable in proposed detectors, such as DUMAND-II, AMANDA, NESTOR and Lake Baikal.	0	24	17
astro-ph/9607173	Anticorrelated Hard/Soft X-Ray Emission from the X-Ray Burster 4U 0614+091	We have detected transient X-ray activity from the X-ray burster 4U~0614+091 simultaneously with BATSE/CGRO (20-100 keV) and ASM/RXTE (1-12 keV). The peak fluxes reach approximately 40 mCrab in both instruments over a period of about 20 days. The variable emission shows a clear anticorrelation of the hard X-ray flux with the soft X-ray count rate. The observed anticorrelation is another clear counterexample to the notion that only black hole binaries exhibit such correlations. The individual spectra during this period can be fit by power laws with photon indices 2.2+-0.3 (ASM) and 2.7+-0.4 (BATSE), while the combined spectra can be described by a single power law with index 2.09+-0.08. BATSE and the ASM/RXTE are a good combination for monitoring X-ray sources over a wide energy band.	0	0	0

The first-order term gives the leading order phase-shift between current and voltage and is associated with the displacement current. It is determined by the emittance which is a capacitance in a capacitive arrangement of edge channels but which is inductive-like if edge channels predominate which transmit charge between different reservoirs. The second-order term is associated with the charge relaxation. We apply our results to a Corbino disc and to two- and four-terminal quantum Hall bars, and we discuss the symmetry properties of the current response. In particular, we calculate the longitudinal resistance and the Hall resistance as a function of frequency.	1	5	5
cond-mat/9607067	Correlations within Eigenvectors and Transition Amplitudes in the Two-Body Random Interaction Model	It is shown that the two-body character of the interaction in a many-body system gives rise to specific correlations between the components of compound states, even if this interaction is completely random. Surprisingly, these correlations increase with the increase of the number of active (valence) particles. Statistical theory of transition amplitudes between compound states, which takes into account these correlation is developed and tested within the framework of the Two-Body Random Interaction Model. It is demonstrated that a feature, which can be called ``correlation resonance'', appears in the distribution of the transition matrix amplitudes, since the correlations strongly reduce the transition amplitudes at the tails and increase them near the maximum of the distribution.	1	48	22

This prescription, which applies also to other gauge theories with non-positive-definite integration measure, also has the advantage of killing finite size effects due to extremely small mean values of the cosine of the phase of the fermion determinant. We also give an explanation for the pathological behaviour of quenched QCD at finite density.	0	1	1

Within the $1/N_c$--expansion the QCD operator is replaced by an effective many-fermion operator, which is averaged over the effective theory of massive quarks derived from instantons. We find $m_0^2 \equiv \langle O_\sigma \rangle / \langle \bar\psi\psi \rangle \approx 4 \bar\rho^{-2} = 1.4 GeV^2$, somewhat larger than the estimate from QCD sum rules for the nucleon.	0	45	36

astro-ph/9610133	Constraints on Hubble's Constant, Omega_baryon and Lambda from Cosmic Microwave Background Observations	In this paper we compare data to theory. We use a compilation of the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements to constrain Hubble's constant h, the baryon fraction Omega_b, and the cosmological constant lambda. We fit h-, Omega_b- and lambda-dependent power spectra to the data. The models we consider are flat cold dark matter (CDM) dominated universes with flat (n=1) power spectra, thus the results obtained apply only to these models. CMB observations can exclude more than half of the h - Omega_b parameter space explored. The CMB data favor low values of Hubble's constant; h \approx 0.35. Low values of Omega_b are preferred (Omega_b ~ 0.03) but the chi-squared minimum is shallow and we obtain Omega_b < 0.28. A model with h \approx 0.40, Omega_b \approx 0.15 and Omega_CDM \approx 0.85 is permitted by constraints from the CMB data, BBN, cluster baryon fractions and the shape parameter Gamma derived from the mass density power spectra of galaxies and clusters. For flat-lambda models, the CMB data, combined with BBN constraints exclude most of the h - lambda plane. Models with Omega_o \approx 0.3, lambda \approx 0.7 with h \approx 0.75 are fully consistent with the CMB data but are excluded by the strict new q_{o} limits from supernovae (Perlmutter et al. 1996). A combination of CMB data goodness-of-fit statistics, BBN and supernovae constraints in the h-lambda plane, limits Hubble's constant to the interval 0.23 < h < 0.72.	0	16	13
astro-ph/9610248	Gravitational Lensing of the X-Ray Background by Clusters of Galaxies	Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies affects the cosmic X-ray background (XRB) by altering the observed density and flux distribution of background X-ray sources. At faint detection flux thresholds, the resolved X-ray sources appear brighter and diluted, while the unresolved component of the XRB appears dimmer and more anisotropic, due to lensing. The diffuse X-ray intensity in the outer halos of clusters might be lower than the sky-averaged XRB, after the subtraction of resolved sources. Detection of the lensing signal with a wide-field X-ray telescope could probe the mass distribution of a cluster out to its virialization boundary. In particular, we show that the lensing signature imprinted on the resolved component of the XRB by the cluster A1689, should be difficult but possible to detect out to 8' at the 2-4 sigma level, after 10^6 seconds of observation with the forthcoming AXAF satellite. The lensing signal is fairly insensitive to the lens redshift in the range 0.1<z<0.6. The amplitude of the lensing signal is however sensitive to the faint end slope of the number-flux relation for unresolved X-ray sources, and can thus help constrain models of the XRB. A search for X-ray arcs or arclets could identify the fraction of all faint sources which originate from extended emission of distant galaxies. The probability for a 3 sigma detection of an arclet which is stretched by a factor of about 3 after a 10^6 seconds observation of A1689 with AXAF, is roughly comparable to the fraction of all background X-ray sources that have an intrinsic size of order 1''.	0	1	1

We use the method of continuous spacetime dimensions to demonstrate that WEP is a robust property of the Brans-Dicke theory beyond the classical level, hence correcting our previous assertion of the contrary. The same technique can be used to yield the violation of WEP when applied to the scale-invariant theory, thus providing another reason for expecting fifth- force-type phenomena.	0	7	1

This technique is optimized at colliders and depends on qualitative features of the R0 hadronic interactions which we discuss in detail.	0	7	5
hep-ph/9610293	Nucleon Decay in a Realistic SO(10) SUSY GUT	In this paper, we calculate neutron and proton decay rates and branching ratios in a predictive SO(10) SUSY GUT which agrees well with low energy data. We show that the nucleon lifetimes are consistent with the experimental bounds. The nucleon decay rates are calculated using all one-loop chargino and gluino dressed diagrams regardless of their chiral structure. We show that the four-fermion operator $C_{jk} (u_R {d_j}_R)({d_k}_L {\nu_\tau}_L)$, commonly neglected in previous nucleon decay calculations, not only contributes significantly to nucleon decay, but, for many values of the initial GUT parameters and for large $\tan\beta$, actually dominates the decay rate. As a consequence, we find that $\tau_p/\tau_n$ is often substantially larger than the prediction obtained in small $\tan\beta$ models. We also find that gluino-dressed diagrams, often neglected in nucleon decay calculations, contribute significantly to nucleon decay. In addition we find that the branching ratios obtained from this realistic SO(10) SUSY GUT differ significantly from the predictions obtained from ``generic" SU(5) SUSY GUTS. Thus nucleon decay branching ratios, when observed, can be used to test theories of fermion masses.	0	97	87
hep-ph/9610424	Higgs and Top Production in the Reaction $γe \to νb \bar{b} W$ at TeV Linear Collider Energies	For an electron-photon collider the complete tree-level cross sections of the reaction $\gamma e \rightarrow \nu b \bar{b} W$ are computed at center-of-mass energies between 0.5 and 2.0 TeV, for top masses of 160 to 200 GeV and Higgs masses between 80 and 140 GeV within the Standard Model. It is shown that most of the $\nu b \bar{b}$ events are due to Higgs and $Z/\gamma^*$ production (with $H, Z/\gamma^* \rightarrow b \bar{b}$ decay) while top production (with $t \rightarrow bW$ decay) is about 50% smaller. Multiperipheral background and interferences are small, respectively negligible, in the energy range studied. By convoluting the basic cross sections with an energy spectrum of the backscattered photon beam, and inserting linear collider luminosities as anticipated in present designs, realistic $\nu b \bar{b} W$ event rates are estimated. This results in large event rates for $\gamma e \rightarrow \nu t b$ and $\gamma e \rightarrow \nu H W$. We estimate that the CKM matrix element $|V_{tb}|$, can be probed from the $\nu t b$ final state to an accuracy of 1-3% at $\sqrt{s_{e^+e^-}} > 1 TeV$. Assuming an effective Lagrangian based on dimension-6 operators we discuss the sensitivity for detecting deviations of the HWW coupling from the Standard Model in the reaction $\gamma e \rightarrow \nu H W$.	0	12	12

astro-ph/9608013	Numerical Simulations of Galaxy Formation	An overview over the current status of modeling galaxies by means of numerical simulations is given. After a short description of how galaxies form in hierarchically clustering scenarios, success and failures of current simulations are demonstrated using three different applications: the morphology of present day galaxies; the appearance of high redshift galaxies; and the nature of the Ly-alpha forest and metal absorption lines. It is shown that current simulations can qualitatively account for many observed features of galaxies. However, the objects which form in these simulations suffer from a strong overcooling problem. Star formation and feedback processes are likely to be indispensable ingredients for a realistic description even of the most basic parameters of a galaxy. The progenitors of todays galaxies are expected to be highly irregular and concentrated, as supported by recent observations. Though they exhibit a velocity dispersion similar to present day L > L^* galaxies, they may be much less massive. The filamentary distribution of the gas provides a natural explanation for Ly-alpha and metal absorption systems. Furthermore, numerical simulations can be used to avoid misinterpretations of observed data and are able to alleviate some apparent contradictions in the size estimates of Ly-alpha absorption systems.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9608014	The Shapes of Dense Cores and Bok Globules	The shapes of isolated Bok globules and embedded dense cores of molecular clouds are analyzed using a nonparametric method, under the alternate hypotheses that they are randomly oriented prolate objects or that they are randomly oriented oblate objects. In all cases, the prolate hypothesis gives a better fit to the data. If Bok globules are oblate, they must be very flat; the average axis ratio is b/a = 0.3, and few or no globules can have b/a > 0.7. If Bok globules are prolate, then the mean axis ratio is b/a = 0.5. For most data samples of dense cores, the randomly-oriented oblate hypothesis can be rejected at the 99% confidence level. If the dense cores are prolate, their mean axis ratio is approximately 0.4 to 0.5. Dense cores are significantly different in shape from the clouds in which they are embedded; clouds have flatter apparent shapes, and are inconsistent with a population of randomly oriented axisymmetric objects.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9608194	Bloated Stars as AGN Broad Line Clouds: The Emission Line Profiles	The Bloated Stars Scenario proposes that AGN broad line emission originates in the winds or envelopes of bloated stars (BS). Alexander and Netzer (1994) established that ~ 5e4 BSs with dense, decelerating winds can reproduce the observed emission line spectrum and avoid rapid collisional destruction. Here, we use the observed properties of AGN line profiles to further constrain the model parameters. In the BS model, the origin of the broad profiles is the stellar velocity field in the vicinity of the central black hole. We use a detailed photoionization code and a model of the stellar distribution function to calculate the BS emission line profiles and compare them to a large sample of AGN CIV, CIII] and MgII profiles. We find that the BSs can reproduce the general shape and width of typical AGN profiles as well as the line ratios if (i) The ionizing luminosity to black hole mass ratio is low enough. (ii) The broad line region size is limited by some cutoff mechanism. (iii) The fraction of the BSs in the stellar population falls off roughly as r^-2. (iv) The wind density and/or velocity are correlated with the black hole mass and ionizing luminosity. Under these conditions the strong tidal forces near the black hole play an important role in determining the line emission properties of the BSs. Some discrepancies remain: the calculated BS profiles tend to have weaker wings than the observed ones, and the differences between the profiles of different lines are somewhat smaller than those observed.	0	0	0
cond-mat/9608009	Comment on "Moving Glass Phase of Driven Lattices"	We consider a periodic lattice rapidly driven through a quenched random potential as a model of a moving Abrikosov lattice. In addition to the transverse phonon displacements $u_y$, we consider the displacements $u_x$ along the direction of motion, which were assumed to be small in earlier treatments. We show that these displacements are in fact divergent even on large length scales and therefore lead to a breakdown of the elastic model along the direction of motion. We propose that the resulting phase is a moving "smectic" with translational order that is quasi-long-range transverse and liquid-like parallel to the direction of motion.	1	46	46
cond-mat/9608010	Deconfined Fermions but Confined Coherence?	The cuprate superconductors and certain organic conductors exhibit transport which is qualitatively anisotropic, yet at the same time other properties of these materials strongly suggest the existence of a Fermi surface and low energy excitations with substantial free electron character. The former of these features is very difficult to account for if the material possesses three dimensional coherence, while the latter is inconsistent with a description based on a two dimensional fixed point. We therefore present a new proposal for these materials in which they are categorized by a fixed point at which transport in one direction is not renormalization group irrelevant, but is intrinsically incoherent, i.e. the incoherence is present in a pure system, at zero temperature. The defining property of such a state is that single electron coherence is confined to lower dimensional subspaces (planes or chains) so that it is impossible to observe interference effects between histories which involve electrons moving between these subspaces.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9608043	A critical assessment of the Self-Interaction Corrected Local Density Functional method and its algorithmic implementation	We calculate the electronic structure of several atoms and small molecules by direct minimization of the Self-Interaction Corrected Local Density Approximation (SIC-LDA) functional.

In our atomic calculations the SIC-LDA yields total energies, ionization energies and charge densities that are superior to results obtained with the Local Density Approximation (LDA). However, for molecules SIC-LDA gives bond lengths and reaction energies that are inferior to those obtained from LDA.

hep-ph/9608420	Cosmological and phenomenological implications of Wilsonian matter in realistic superstring derived models	Superstring phenomenology aims at achieving two goals. The first is to reproduce the observed physics of the Standard Model. The second is to identify experimental signatures of superstring unification which, if observed, will provide further evidence for the validity of superstring theory. I discuss such potential signatures of superstring unification. I propose that proton lifetime constraints imply that the Standard Model gauge group must be obtained directly at the string level. In this case the unifying gauge group, for example $SO(10)$, is broken to the Standard Model gauge group by ``Wilson lines''. The symmetry breaking by ``Wilson line'' has important implications. It gives rise to exotic massless states which cannot fit into multiplets of the original unifying gauge group. This is an important feature because it results in conservation laws which forbid the interaction of the exotic ``Wilsonian'' states with the Standard Model states. The ``Wilsonian'' matter states then have important phenomenological implications. I discuss two such implications: exotic ``Wilsonian'' states as dark matter candidates and ``Wilsonian'' matter as the messenger sector in gauge mediated dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios.	0	6	4

hep-th/9608160	Gauge parameter dependence and gauge invariance in the Abelian Higgs model	We analyze gauge parameter dependence by using an algebraic method which relates the gauge parameter dependence of Green functions to an enlarged Slavnov-Taylor identity. In the course of the renormalization it turns out that gauge parameter dependence of physical parameters is already restricted at the level of Green functions. In a first step we consider the on-shell conditions which we find to be in complete agreement with these restrictions to all orders of perturbation theory. The fixing of the coupling, however, is much more involved outside the complete on-shell scheme. In the Abelian Higgs model we prove that this fixing can be properly chosen by requiring the Ward identity of gauge invariance to hold in its tree form to all orders of perturbation theory.	0	12	5
astro-ph/9609201	ASCA and ROSAT observations of distant massive cooling flows	We present the results from a detailed ASCA/ROSAT X-ray study of three distant, massive cooling flows; Zwicky 3146 (z=0.291), Abell 1835 (z=0.252) and E1455+223 (Zwicky 7160; z=0.258). Using multiphase models fitted to the ASCA spectra, we determine values for the temperature, metallicity, luminosity and cooling rates in the clusters. These results are combined with deprojection analyses of the ROSAT images to provide detailed constraints on the mass distributions in the systems, and on the properties of their cooling flows. The spectral and imaging data identify these clusters as the three most-massive cooling flows known, with mass deposition rates of ~ 1400, 2300, and 1500 solar masses per year, respectively. We highlight the need for multiphase models to consistently model the spectral and imaging X-ray data, and discuss the importance of using these models in X-ray determinations of the cluster masses. We also present results from an extensive optical study of the clusters and report the discovery of a gravitational arc in Abell 1835. The lensing data provide an indepenent constraint on the distribution of mass in the cluster, in good agreement with the results from the mutliphase (although not single-phase) X-ray analysis. We present measurements of the galaxy distributions in Abell 1835 and E1455+223 and relate these to the distributions of the total mass. The ASCA spectra place firm constraints on the column density of intrinsic X-ray absorbing material in the clusters. Abell 1835 and E1455+223 exhibit large intrinsic column densities associated with their cooling flows. These clusters also exhibit significant amounts of reddening in the optical spectra of their central galaxies. The data for Zwicky 3146 indicate lower lower levels of X-ray absorption and reddening.

We check resp. improve previously obtained values for other critical exponents and perform a first investigation of the critical behaviour of the slowest relaxational mode. We also investigate the possibility of describing the critical point in terms of a distribution of the global density. We find that some qualitative features such as a temporal oscillation and a power law of the cluster-size distribution can nicely be obtained from such a model that discards the spatial structure.	1	7	7

The model exhibits soliton solutions of closed vortex type which have a lower topological bound on their energies.

chao-dyn/9611013	Unified Model for The Study of Diffusion Localization and Dissipation	A new model that generalizes the study of quantum Brownian motion (BM) is constructed. We consider disordered environment that may be either static (quenched), noisy or dynamical. The Zwanzig-Caldeira-Leggett BM-model constitutes formally a special case where the disorder auto-correlation length is taken to be infinite. Alternatively, localization problem is obtained if the noise auto-correlation time is taken to be infinite. Also the general case of weak nonlinear coupling to thermal, possibly chaotic bath is handled by the same formalism. A general, Feynman-Vernon type path-integral expression for the propagator is introduced. Wigner transformed version of this expression is utilized in order to facilitate comparison with the classical limit. It is demonstrated that non-stochastic genuine quantal manifestations are associated with the new model. It is clarified that such effects are absent in the standard BM model, either the disorder or the chaotic nature of the bath are essential. Quantal correction to the classical diffusive behavior is found even in the limit of high temperatures. The suppression of interference due to dephasing is discussed, leading to the observation that due to the disorder the decay of coherence is exponential in time, and no longer depends on geometrical considerations. Fascinating non-Markovian effects due to time-correlated (colored) noise are explored. For this, a new strategy is developed in order to handle the integration over paths. This strategy is extended in order to demonstrate how localization comes out from the path integral expression.	0	21	3

Motivated by the ideas of Calzetta and Hu on correlation histories we employ the Zwanzig projection technique to obtain evolution equations for relevant observables in self-interacting scalar field theories. Our coarse-graining operation consists in concentrating solely on the evolution of the correlation functions of degree less than $n$, a treatment which corresponds to the familiar from statistical mechanics truncation of the BBKGY hierarchy at the n-th level. We derive the equations governing the evolution of mean field and two-point functions thus identifying the terms corresponding to dissipation and noise. We discuss possible applications of our formalism, the emergence of classical behaviour and the connection to the decoherent histories framework.	0	10	2

No explicit knowledge of the structure of the twisted sectors is required. Further, we propose a general set of sufficiency conditions, illustrated in the context of a third order no-fixed-point twist of a lattice theory, for verifying consistency of arbitrary orbifold models in terms of the states representing the twisted sectors.	0	1	1

astro-ph/9612085	Primordial Nucleosynthesis with Massive Tau Neutrinos	A massive long-lived tau neutrino in the MeV regime modifies the primordial light-element abundances predicted by big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This effect has been used to derive limits on the tau neutrino mass. Because recently the observational situation has become somewhat confusing and, in part, intrinsically inconsistent, we reconsider the BBN limits on the tau neutrino mass. To this end we use our newly developed BBN code to calculate the primordial abundances as a function of the tau neutrino mass and of the cosmic baryon density eta. We derive concordance regions in the eta - tau-neutrino-mass - plane for several sets of alleged primordial abundances. In some cases a concordance region exists only for a nonvanishing tau neutrino mass. At the present time BBN does not provide clear evidence for or against a tau neutrino mass.	0	8	0
astro-ph/9612201	The Evidence for Massive Star Formation in Early-Type Spiral Galaxies	A recent analysis of the IRAS database indicates that the massive star formation rates in early-type (Sa-Sab) spirals are comparable to the massive star formation rates in late-type spirals. $H\alpha$ imaging of some of the infrared luminous early-type spirals reveals two types of galaxies. One type shows clear signs of interaction, whereas the other type appears to host a nuclear starburst. The occurence of nuclear starbursts in early-type spirals may be related to the propensity for such galaxies to also host Seyfert nuclei. The evidence for interactions suggests that early-type spirals are evolving in the current epoch.	0	0	0

By mapping it to a ferromagnetic superspin chain, and using a scaling analysis, we show its equivalence to a one-dimensional supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model in the scaling limit, for any value of the ratio L/C, except for short systems where L is less than of order C^{1/2}. For the sigma model, the universal crossover functions for the conductance and its variance have been determined previously. We also show that the DN model can be mapped directly onto the random matrix (Fokker-Planck) approach to disordered quasi-one-dimensional wires, which implies that the entire distribution of the conductance is the same as in the latter system, for any value of L/C in the same scaling limit. The results of Chalker and Dohmen are explained quantitatively.	1	29	21

hep-ph/9612471	Notes on the Kinematic Structure of the Three-Flavor Neutrino Oscillation Framework	These notes present a critique of the standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation framwork. The design proposal of the MINOS at Fermilab based on a two mass eigenstate framework may require serious reconsideration if there is strong mixing between all three flavors of neutrinos. For the LSND and KARMEN neutrino oscillation experiments, the amplitude of neutrino oscillation of the ``one mass scale dominance''framework vanishes for certain values of mixing angles as a result of opposite signs of two equal and opposite contributions. Recent astronomical observations leave open the possibility that one of the neutrino mass eigenstates may be non-relativistic in some instances. Neutrino oscillation phenomenology with a superposition of two relativistic, and one non-relativistic, mass eigenstates is constructed. It is concluded that if the transition from the non-relativistic to the relativistic regime happens for energies relevant to the Reactor and the LSND neutrino oscillation experiments then one must consider an ab intio analysis of the existing data.	0	10	8
math/9612203	Polynomial Diffeomorphisms of C^2: VI. Connectivity of J	Given a polynomial diffeomorphism f: C^2 -> C^2 there is a set $J_f\subset{\bf C}^2$ which we call the Julia set of f. The set $J_f\subset C^2$ plays the role of the Julia set $J\subset{\bf C}$ for a polynomial map of C. In the study of polynomial maps of C a great deal of attention has been paid to the connectivity of the Julia set. The focus of this paper is to investigate the J-connected/J-disconnected dichotomy in the case of polynomial diffeomorphisms of C^2. The Jacobian determinant of f is constant. We make the standing assumption that $|det\ Df|\le 1$ (this can always be achieved by replacing f by $f^{-1}$ if necessary). The set $J^-$ is the set of points with bounded backward orbits. The set $U^+$ is the set of points with unbounded forward orbits. Let p be a periodic saddle point and let $W^u(p)$ be its unstable manifold. The set $W^u(p)$ will be a Riemann surface conformally equivalent to C. Theorem 1. The following are equivalent: 1. For some periodic saddle point p, some component of $W^u(p)\cap U^+$ is simply connected. 2. The set $J^-\cap U^+$ has a lamination by simply connected leaves so that for any periodic saddle point p each component of $W^u(p)\cap U^+$ is a leaf of this lamination. 3. For any periodic saddle point p, each component of $W^u(p)\cap U^+$ is simply connected. If f satisfies one of these conditions we say that f is unstably connected. Theorem 2. The set J is connected if and only if f is unstably connected. These results imply that we can determine the connectivity of J by considering the forward orbits of points in a single unstable manifold. These results open the door to computer exploration of the topology of two dimensional Julia sets and the connectivity locus in the parameter space.	0	1	0

physics/9612007	A dynamical model of the chemical bond	A new approach to chemical bonding is introduced in order to provide an improved understanding of the connection between basic quantum mechanics and the covalent pair bond. It's focus is on the fact that the energy of the bond is largely given by the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the Coulomb forces are only comparable to the kinetic energy terms close to the atomic nuclei, where they define the shape and the size of the atomic orbitals. If atomic orbitals are used as a starting point, the kinetic energy operator is sufficient to determine the energy of the chemical bond. The simple mathematical structure of this operator allows a calculation of bond energy as a function of the distance between the atoms. For Gaussian wavefunctions, it is possible to calculate this bonding potential analytically, determining the bond length, the bond energy and the elasticity of the bond from only a single parameter, the width of the atomic wavefunction. It is shown that the results correspond surprisingly well with experimental values for diatomic molecules.	0	0	0

astro-ph/9701127	X-ray Observations of LINER and Starburst Galaxies	We present the results of ASCA observations of a heterogenous sample of 15 spiral galaxies. 8 are LINERs or low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN), 5 are starburst galaxies and 2 are normal spiral galaxies. We find that in all cases the ASCA spectra can be described by a canonical model consisting of a power-law with a photon index ~ 1.7-2.0, plus a soft optically thin emission component with kT ~ 0.6-0.8 keV. The implied element abundances are often sub-solar. The soft component is usually extended and the nuclear, point-like emission is sometimes absorbed by column densities in the range log nH ~ 21-23 cm-2. The relative luminosities of the soft and hard components vary from galaxy to galaxy. For the LINERs, the 2-10 keV luminosity of the hard component is typically log L ~ 40-41 ergs/s whereas the 0.5-2.0 keV luminosity of the soft component is typically log L ~ 39-40 ergs/s. For starbursts, the 2-10 keV luminosity of is log L ~ 39-40 ergs/s, somewhat lower than the corresponding luminosity of most of the LINERs in our sample. The hard component is similar to the observed X-ray spectra of quasars and also to the intrinsic X-ray spectra of classical Seyfert galaxies. Most of the galaxies in our sample exhibit no significant (dI/I > 20%) short-term variability (with timescales of a day or less) whereas long-term variability is common. We present a case study of the LINER M81 in detail where there is evidence of large-amplitude (dI/I ~ 70%) variability over several weeks. There is also clear evidence for a broad, complex Fe-K emission line which is compatible with an origin in an accretion disk viewed at ~ 40 deg. These results suggest a strong connection between classical AGN, LINERs, and starburst galaxies.	0	1	1

cond-mat/9701158	Gap Opening Transition and Fractal Ground State Phase Diagram in One Dimensional Fermions with Long Range Interaction : Mott Transition as a Quantum Phase Transition of Infinite Order	The metal-insulator transition in one dimensional fermionic systems with long-range interaction is investigated. We have focused on an excitation spectrum by the exact diagonalization technique in sectors with different momentum quantum numbers. At rational fillings, we have demonstrated gap opening transitions from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to the Mott insulator associated with a discrete symmetry breaking by changing the interaction strength. Finite interaction range is crucial to have the Mott transition at a rational filling away from the half filling. It is consistent with the strong coupling picture where the Mott gap exists at any rational fillings with sufficiently strong interaction. The critical regions as a quantum phase transition are also investigated numerically. Non-analytic behavior of the Mott gap is the characteristic in the weak coupling. It is of the order of the interaction in the strong coupling. It implies that the metal-insulator transition of the model is of the infinite order as a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Fractal nature of the ground state phase diagram is also revealed.	1	1	1

In a Monte Carlo simulation of QCD with $N_f =16$ staggered fermions, we find clear evidence of a first order bulk phase transition which separates phases with broken and unbroken chiral symmetry. This is consistent with extrapolations of earlier studies with smaller $N_f$, and is also as expected from general arguments. Thus, even when the perturbative renormalization group flow has a new infrared stable fixed point near the origin, lattice artifacts induce chiral symmetry breaking, and presumably confinement, at sufficiently strong coupling.	0	64	45

astro-ph/9702196	An Upper Limit to Arcminute Scale Anisotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation at 142 GHz	We present limits to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) at angular scales of a few arcminutes. The observations were made at a frequency of 142 GHz using a 6-element bolometer array (the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Infrared Experiment) at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. Two patches of sky, each approximately 36'x4' and free of known sources, were observed for a total of 6-8 hours each, resulting in approximately 80 independent 1.7' full-width half-maximum pixels. Each pixel is observed with both a dual-beam and a triple-beam chop, with a sensitivity per pixel of 90-150 uK in each chop. These data have been analyzed using maximum likelihood techniques by assuming a gaussian autocorrelation function for the distribution of CMB fluctuations on the sky. We set an upper limit of Delta T/T <= 2.1 x 10^{-5} (95% confidence) for a coherence angle to the fluctuations of 1.1. These limits are comparable to the best limits obtained from centimeter-wavelength observations on similar angular scales but have the advantage that the contribution from known point sources is negligible at these frequencies. They are the most sensitive millimeter-wavelength limits for coherence angles <= 3'. The results are also considered in the context of secondary sources of anisotropy, specifically the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from galaxy clusters.	0	0	0

The period of the charge-density wave is generically half that of the spin-density wave, or equivalently the charges form antiphase domain walls in the antiferromagnetic order. A sharp distinction exists between the case in which the ordering is primarily charge driven (which produces a sequence of transitions in qualitative agreement with experiment) or spin driven (which does not). We also find that stripes with non-collinear spin order (i.e. spiral phases) are possible in a region of the phase diagram where the transition is spin driven; the spiral is circular only when there is no charge order, and is otherwise elliptical with an eccentricity proportional to the magnitude of the charge order.	1	12	5
cond-mat/9702169	Direct Mott Insulator-to-Superfluid Transition in the Presence of Disorder	We introduce a new renormalization group theory to examine the quantum phase transitions upon exiting the insulating phase of a disordered, strongly interacting boson system. For weak disorder we find a direct transition from this Mott insulator to the Superfluid phase. In d > 4 a finite region around the particle-hole symmetric point supports this direct transition, whereas for 2=< d <4 perturbative arguments suggest that the direct transition survives only precisely at commensurate filling. For strong disorder the renormalization trajectories pass next to two fixed points, describing a pair of distinct transitions; first from the Mott insulator to the Bose glass, and then from the Bose glass to the Superfluid.

A plot of $\nu\frac{2S}{N-1}$ as a function of $2S$ for a constant number of particles (up to N=10001) exhibits structure of the fractional quantum Hall effect. It is confirmed that $\nu_e +\nu_h=1$ for all particle-hole conjugate systems, except systems with $N_e =N_h$, and $N_e=N_h \pm 1$.	1	0	0

This hypothesis was formulated recently by I.A.Taimanov (dg-ga/9610013). Higher analogs of the Willmore functional are defined in terms of the Modified Novikov-Veselov hierarchy. This soliton hierarchy is associated with the zero-energy scattering problem for the two-dimensional Dirac operator.	0	12	0
gr-qc/9702044	Chaos in Anisotropic Pre-Inflationary Universes	We study the dynamics of anisotropic Bianchi type-IX models with matter and cosmological constant. The models can be thought as describing the role of anisotropy in the early stages of inflation. The concurrence of the cosmological constant and anisotropy are sufficient to produce a chaotic dynamics in the gravitational degrees of freedom, connected to the presence of a critical point of saddle-center type in the phase space of the system. The invariant character of chaos is guaranteed by the topology of the cylinders emanating from unstable periodic orbits in the neighborhood of the saddle-center. We discuss a possible mechanism for amplification of specific wavelengths of inhomogeneous fluctuations in the models. A geometrical interpretation is given for Wald's inequality in terms of invariant tori and their destruction by increasing values of the cosmological constant.	0	14	13
hep-ph/9702254	CP-Violating Reflection of High Energy Fermions during a first order Phase Transition	We study the high energy behaviour of fermions hitting a general wall caused by a first-order phase transition. The wall profile is introduced through general analytic and non-analytic functions. The reflection coefficient is computed in the high energy limit and its connection with the analytic properties of the wall profile function is shown. The high energy behaviour of the fermions hitting the wall is determined either by the leading singularity, i.e. the closest pole to the real axis, when the profile function is analytic, or by the first non-continuous derivative on the real axis, in the non-analytic case. CP-violating wall profiles are studied and it is shown that the respective symmetry properties of the CP-conserving and CP-violating profile functions plays an important role on the size of the CP asymmetry.	0	0	0

A method of reduction is then suggested for simplifying the computation of the bounce action. Some phenomenological applications are described.	0	2	2

This work is based on the work of R. Cutkosky and collaborators at CMU about 20 years ago. The model features analyticity at the amplitude level and unitarity. Results are similar to previous analyses for strongly excited states, but can vary considerably from previous analyses when the states are weak, the data is poor, or there is a strong model dependence.

quant-ph/9702026	Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking, Off-diagonal Long-range Order, and Nucleation of Quantum State	Spontaneous symmetry breaking originats in quantum mechanical measurement of the relevant observable defining the physical situation, order parameter is the average of this observable. A modification is made on the random-phase postulate validating the ensemble description. Off-diagonal long-range order, macroscopic wavefunction and interference effects in many-particle systems present when there is a so-called nucleation of quantum state, which is proposed to be the origin of spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, for which nonconservation of particle number N is not essential. The approach based on nonvanishing expectation of the field operator, $<\hat{\psi}(\vec{r})>$, is only a coherent-state approximation in thermodynamic limit. When $N \to \infty$, this approach is equivalent, but $<\hat{\psi}(\vec{r})>$ is not the macroscopic wavefunction.	0	1	0
alg-geom/9703009	A Remark on the Geometry of Elliptic Scrolls and Bielliptic Surfaces	The union of two quintic elliptic scrolls in P^4 intersecting transversally along an elliptic normal quintic curve is a singular surface Z which behaves numerically like a bielliptic surface. In the appendix to the paper [W. Decker et al.: Syzygies of abelian and bielliptic surfaces in P^4, alg-geom/9606013] where the equations of this singular surface were computed, we proved that Z defines a smooth point in the appropriate Hilbert scheme and that Z cannot be smoothed in P^4. Here we consider the analogous situation in higher dimensional projective spaces P^{n-1}, where, to our surprise, the answer depends on the dimension n-1. If n is odd the union of two scrolls cannot be smoothed, whereas it can be smoothed if n is even. We construct an explicit smoothing.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9703183	Hydra: A Parallel Adaptive Grid Code	We describe the first parallel implementation of an adaptive particle-particle, particle-mesh code with smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Parallelisation of the serial code, ``Hydra'', is achieved by using CRAFT, a Cray proprietary language which allows rapid implementation of a serial code on a parallel machine by allowing global addressing of distributed memory. The collisionless variant of the code has already completed several 16.8 million particle cosmological simulations on a 128 processor Cray T3D whilst the full hydrodynamic code has completed several 4.2 million particle combined gas and dark matter runs. The efficiency of the code now allows parameter-space explorations to be performed routinely using $64^3$ particles of each species. A complete run including gas cooling, from high redshift to the present epoch requires approximately 10 hours on 64 processors. In this paper we present implementation details and results of the performance and scalability of the CRAFT version of Hydra under varying degrees of particle clustering.	0	7	7

For random coupling the intruder does not affect the GOE spectral statistics of the background significantly, while a constant coupling causes very strong correlations at short range with a fourth power dependence of the spectral two-point function at the origin.The revival probability is significantly depressed for constant coupling as compared to random coupling.	0	0	0
cond-mat/9703118	Dynamical mean-field theory of the small polaron	A dynamical mean-field theory of the small polaron problem is presented, which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dimensions. The ground state properties and the one-electron spectral function are obtained for a single electron interacting with Einstein phonons by a mapping of the lattice problem onto a polaronic impurity model. The one-electron propagator of the impurity model is calculated through a continued fraction expansion (CFE), both at zero and finite temperature, for any electron-phonon coupling and phonon energy. In contrast to the ground state properties such as the effective polaron mass, which have a smooth behaviour, spectral properties exhibit a sharp qualitative change at low enough phonon frequency: beyond a critical coupling, one energy gap and then more and more open in the density of states at low energy, while the high energy part of the spectrum is broad and can be explained by a strong coupling adiabatic approximation. As a consequence narrow and coherent low-energy subbands coexist with an incoherent featureless structure at high energy. The subbands denote the formation of quasiparticle polaron states. Also, divergencies of the self-energy may occur in the gaps. At finite temperature such effect triggers an important damping and broadening of the polaron subbands. On the other hand, in the large phonon frequency regime such a separation of energy scales does not exist and the spectrum has always a multipeaked structure.	1	3	1

We then study the effect of global monopole charge on particle orbits and the Hawking radiation. It turns out that existence, boundedness and stability of circular orbits scale up by $(1-8 \pi\eta^2)^{-1}$, and the perihelion shift and the light bending by $(1-8 \pi\eta^2)^{-3/2}$, while the Hawking temperature scales down by $(1 - 8 \pi \eta^2)^2$ the Schwarzschild values.

The comparison with results of the truncated theory is made. For $m=1/2$, it was found that families of solutions with extrema no longer remain in the full case, and they are replaced by asymptotically Minkowski evolutions. These solutions are monotonic.	0	26	19

Given the phenomenological relevance and the fact that this two-loop calculation has been done so far only by one group [1], we present a detailed re-calculation using a different method.

hep-ph/9703359	Quark mass effects in QCD jets	The effects induced by the quark masses in three-jet observables have been studied in this thesis. In particular, we have explored a new method: the study of three-jet observables at LEP, different from QCD Sum Rules and Lattice calculations, for determining the b-quark mass. Among other advantages, it would allow to extract the b quark mass far from threshold, in contrast to the other methods described above and it would provide a test of the QCD Renormalization Group predictions. From our NLO calculation, we have estimated, by exploring the $\mu$-dependence of our prediction at m_Z, a theoretical b-quark mass uncertainty of at most 250(MeV) in the DURHAM algorithm, 300(MeV) for JADE and EM and 500(MeV) for the E algorithm. Furthermore, quark mass effects are expected to be quite more important in top production at NLC (Next Linear Collider) and our calculation would be of a great interest.	0	28	27

These processes provide several options to explore the space-time evolution of small size quark-gluon configurations. Furthermore, we study the dependence of the production cross section on the energy and momentum transfer t due to variations of the finite longitudinal interaction length. Kinematic regions are determined where the production cross section is most sensitive to the final state interaction of the initially produced hadronic wave packet. For unpolarized deuteron targets this double scattering contribution can be investigated mainly at large values of the momentum transfer t. For polarized targets kinematic windows sensitive to double scattering are available also at moderate t. We suggest several methods for an investigation of color coherence effects at intermediate energies.	0	13	2

We find that the anomalous charm quark coupling parameter $\kappa_c / \Lambda$ can be measured down to $.06 TeV^{-1}(.009 TeV^{-1}$) at the Tevatron with the Main Injector upgrade(LHC).

This index is determined for generic models as a function of the BPS spectrum.

nucl-th/9703041	Comment on "A Search for Narrow Sum Energy Lines in Electron-Positron Pair Emission from Heavy Ion collisions near the Coulomb Barrier"	The report of Ahmad et al., states that ``No evidence is found for sharp peaks in the present data.'' But this statement is factually inaccurate. Figure 1 exhibits the APEX' published U + Th ``wedge cut'' data, and background, which show a distinct (3.2 sigma) maximum of 83 excess pair counts in the 20 keV bin near 790 keV. A one-gaussian best fit to this excess reduces chi-squared (for the 21 bins from 500 to 920 keV) by 12.6 from 28.3 to 16.7, and the reduced chi-squared value from 1.41 to 0.98. Furthermore, at the 99% Confidence Level, the data impose lower and upper bounds of (24, 146) respectively upon the mean excess pair count in this bin. This data therefore provides positive, statistically significant evidence for sharp pairs near 790 keV. Whether this evidence is compelling is a separate question not addressed here.	0	2	2

As in Sridhar and Touma (1997), a black hole of arbitrary mass may be added at the centre, without destroying the St\"ackel form of the potentials. The construction uses a classic method, originally due to Kuzmin (1956), which is here extended to parabolic coordinates. The models are highly oblate, and the cusps are "weak", with the density, $\rho \propto 1/r^k$, where $0<k<1$.	0	0	0

We find that at the exhaustion of central helium SMR stars definitely undergo the gravonuclear instabilities previously found in some He burning structures with solar metallicity (Bono et al. 1997b). On the basis of the evolutionary scenario, we investigate the expected pulsational behavior of He burning SMR stars for suitable assumptions on the pulsators evolutionary parameters. Nonlinear, nonlocal, and time-dependent convective models are discussed, the modal stability is investigated for the first two modes, and the theoretical predictions about the period distribution inside the instability strip and the shape of both light and velocity curves are presented. Full amplitude, nonlinear envelope models show that the range of effective temperatures where SMR RR Lyrae variables present a stable limit cycle is smaller in comparison with pulsators characterized by lower metal abundances. We show that both periods and light curves of different groups of type II Cepheids with periods shorter than six days, presented by Diethelm (1983,1990), can be all reproduced by suitable variations in the effective temperature or in the luminosity level of our SMR post-HB models, supporting evidence of a substantial homogeneity of these variable.	0	0	0

They are the only stable regular distributions besides the contact, quasi-contact and line fields. If an arbitrary two-plane field on a four-manifold is slightly perturbed then it will be Engel at generic points. On the other hand, if a manifold admits an oriented Engel structure then the manifold must be parallelizable and consequently the alleged Engel distribution must have a degeneration loci -- a point set where the Engel conditions fails. By a theorem of Zhitomirskii this locus is a finite union of surfaces. We prove that these surfaces represent Chern classes associated to the distribution.	0	1	0

It is proven that if more than a single magnetic charge exists it is impossible to define a proper quantum mechanical angular momentum operator for an electrically charged particle in the field of the magnetic charges. Assuming that quantum mechanics is correct we conclude that free magnetic charges (i.e. magnetic charges with a Coulomb-like magnetic field) can not exist. The only apparent way to avoid this conclusion is if magnetic charges do exist, they must be permanently confined in monopole anti-monopole pairs, much in the same way quarks are thought to be confined.	0	0	0

For theories with an algebra of constraints of special form (to which a majority of the physically interesting theories belongs) the method of constructing the generator of local-symmetry transformations is obtained from the requirement of the quasi-invariance of an action. It is proved that second-class constraints do not contribute to the transformation law of the local symmetry which entirely is stipulated by all the first-class constraints. It is thereby shown that degeneracy of special form theories with the first- and second-class constraints is due to their quasi-invariance under local-symmetry transformations.	0	2	2

For a restricted background, T-duality transformations are then studied at the next order, and the ensuing consistency conditions are found to be satisfied by the two-loop Weyl anomaly coefficients of the model. This represents an extremely non-trivial test of the covariance of renormalization group flows under T-duality, and a stronger condition than T-duality invariance of the string background effective action.	0	24	24

We find that there are striking signatures in the charged current which already serve to rule out many possibilities, including the (symmetric) intrinsic charm hypothesis. For those not ruled out, interesting signals are predicted in e^-p scattering.	0	16	16
hep-ph/9705406	Signals of spontaneous R parity breaking at LEP and at a linear collider	We study the production of neutralinos and charginos at LEP and at a linear collider in the case of spontaneously broken R-parity. We first investigate the constraints on the single neutralino and chargino production from the LEP 1 experiments, and then we consider the production at LEP 2 and at a linear collider. We concentrate on the supersymmetric $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ model, where the spontaneous R-parity breaking is inevitable and is associated with the breaking of the LR-symmetry.	0	16	16
hep-ph/9705416	Pursuing the Strange Stop Interpretation of the HERA Large Q^2 data	We explore the possible interpretation of the large-$Q^2$ anomaly reported by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations in terms of stop squark production off a strange quark in the proton via an R-violating interaction. This "strange stop" interpretation is constrained by LEP measurements of the $Z \to e^+ e^-$ decay rate in addition to constraints from the electroweak $\rho$ parameter and CDF and D0 searches for first-generation leptoquarks. We investigate the interplay between these constraints, taking full account of stop mixing effects. We find that if $m_{\tilde t} \le 200$ GeV only relatively small domains of the chargino and neutralino parameters are consistent with these constraints, and explore the extent to which this scenario may be probed further by searches for contact interactions at LEP~2 and experiments with $e^-$ and polarized beams at HERA.	0	48	46

hep-th/9705115	On the black hole unitarity issue	I discuss features required for preserving unitarity in black hole decay and concepts underlying such a perspective. Unitarity requires that correlations extend on the scale of the horizon. I show, in a toy model inspired by string theories, that such correlations can indeed arise. The model suggests that, after a time of order 4M ln M following the onset of Hawking radiation, quantum effects could maintain throughout the decay a collapsing star within a Planck distance of its Schwarzschild radius. In this way information loss would be avoided. The concept of black hole ``complementarity'', which could reconcile these macroscopic departures from classical physics with the equivalence principle, is interpreted in terms of weak values of quantum operators.	0	1	1
q-alg/9705024	Classification of the quantum deformation of the superalgebra $GL(1|1)$	We present a classification of the possible quantum deformations of the supergroup $GL(1|1)$ and its Lie superalgebra $gl(1|1)$. In each case, the (super)commutation relations and the Hopf structures are explicitly computed. For each $R$ matrix, one finds two inequivalent coproducts whether one chooses an unbraided or a braided framework while the corresponding structures are isomorphic as algebras. In the braided case, one recovers the classical algebra $gl(1|1)$ for suitable limits of the deformation parameters but this is no longer true in the unbraided case.	0	0	0

astro-ph/9706011	Bi-Directional Relativistic Jets of the Radio Galaxy 1946+708: Constraints on the Hubble Constant	We present measurements of bi-directional motions in the jets of the radio galaxy 1946+708 at z=0.101. This is a Compact Symmetric Object with striking S-symmetry. Sensitive 15 GHz observations reveal a compact component at the center of symmetry with a strongly inverted spectrum, that we identify as the core. From five 4.9 GHz observations spread over 4 years we have determined the velocities of four compact jet components. If simple kinematic models can be applied then the inclination of the source and the bulk jet velocity can be directly determined for any assumed value of the Hubble constant. Conversely, the measurements already place constraints on the Hubble constant, and we show how further observations of 1946+708 can yield an increasingly accurate determination of H_0.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9706135	Complex outburst behaviour from the black-hole candidate 4U 1630-47	We present data from different epochs in 1978, 1987-1991 and 1996 from the black-hole candidate 4U1630-47. For the first time we present almost complete coverage of the outbursts which started in 1987, 1988 and 1996. We find that the outburst behaviour of 4U1630-47 is more complex than previously realized. The source shows outbursts with durations on the order of ~100-200 days and sometimes intervals of long-term X-ray activity. The relatively short outbursts which occurred in 1987 and 1996 exhibited different colour behaviour: the outburst in 1987 showed softening of the X-ray spectrum, whereas the outburst in 1996 showed hardening of the X-ray spectrum, as the outbursts proceeded. The outburst which started in 1977 may have lasted for up to ~10 months, whereas the outburst which started in 1988 showed activity for up to ~2.4 years. Such long-term activity is reminiscent of that seen in GRS1716-249 and in the galactic superluminal sources GRS1915+105 and GROJ1655-40. We refine the outburst ephemeris of 4U\1630-47 and find that the outburst recurrence time scale may have changed from ~600 days to ~690 days between the 1984 and 1987 outbursts. If the recurrence interval of ~690 days continues, the next outburst of 4U1630-47 is predicted to occur in 1998 January.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9706291	CO (J=3-2) Emission in the Radio Galaxy 53W002 at z=2.394	We report a sensitive search for redshifted CO (3-2) emission from the weak radio galaxy 53W002 at z=2.394. Maps at resolutions of 3 arcsec and 235km/s show a significant emission peak within 0.5 arcsec of the optical and radio continuum peaks. The measured narrow band flux is approximately ten times the extrapolated cm-wavelength non-thermal radio continuum expected at 101.9 GHz and exhibits a spectral profile implying a 540 km/s width (FWHM) at a systemic redshift z=2.394 for CO (3-2). This emission has a total integrated flux of 1.51(+/-0.2) Jy km/s, approximately four times weaker than that previously seen in the lensed systems FSC10214+4724 and the Cloverleaf QSO. For a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion ratio, the implied molecular gas mass is 7.4x10^10 solar masses (H=75 km/s/Mpc and q=0.5). The CO emission is elongated at P.A.=120 degrees with a deconvolved major axis radius of 15 kpc (2.8 arcsec). This extension is along a similar direction to that seen in the cm-wave radio continuum and the optical but approximately three times larger. A velocity gradient is seen along the major axis, and if this structure is a (forming) disk, the implied dynamical mass is 9-22x10^10 solar masses at radii less than or equal to 15 kpc, assuming inclination i=0 degrees (edge-on). The magnitude of these masses and the similarity of the high gas-mass fraction are consistent with the host galaxy of 53W002 being a young galactic system, but the metallicity (probably greater than or equal to 0.1 solar in order to produce the CO lines) implies significant heavy element production prior to z=2.4. This constitutes the first high redshift molecular gas which is detected in emission where there is probably no gravitational magnification.	0	1	1
chao-dyn/9706027	Lasing Threshold and Mode Competition in Chaotic Cavities	The lasing threshold is studied of a multi-mode chaotic cavity (linear size D >> wavelength \lambda) coupled to the outside through a small hole (linear size d << \lambda). For sufficiently weak absorption by the boundaries, the statistical distribution of the threshold is wide, its mean value being much less than the pumping rate needed to compensate the average loss. The average number N_{nc} >> 1 of non-competing excited modes is proportional to the square root of the pumping rate. We use the classical model of spatial hole burning to account for mode competition and find a reduction in the average number of excited modes to N =3^{1/3} N_{nc}^{2/3}.	0	31	3
cond-mat/9706020	Ring Kinetic Theory for an Idealized Granular Gas	The dynamics of inelastic hard spheres is described in terms of the binary collision expansion, yielding the corresponding pseudo-Liouville equation and BBGKY hierarchy for the reduced distribution functions. Based on cluster expansion techniques we derive the Boltzmann and ring kinetic equations for inelastic hard spheres. In the simple ring approximation, we calculate the structure factor of vorticity fluctuations in a freely evolving, dilute granular gas. The kinetic theory result agrees with the result, derived previously from fluctuating hydrodynamics. In the limit of incompressible flow, this structure factor alone determines the spatial velocity correlations, which are of dynamic origin and include long range $r^{-d}$-behavior. The analytic results are compared with MD simulations.	1	5	4
cond-mat/9706183	Renormalization-group approach to the metal-insulator transitions in (DCNQI)_2M (DCNQI is N,N'-dicyanoquinonediimine and M=Ag, Cu)	Metal-insulator transitions and different ground-state phases in quasi-one- dimensional materials, (R_1R_2-DCNQI)_2M (R_1=R_2=CH_3, I and M=Ag, Cu), are studied with a renormalization-group method. We use one-dimensional continuum models with backward scatterings, umklapp processes and couplings with 2k_F and 4k_F phonons (not static lattice distortion). We take a quarter- filled band for M=Ag and a sixth-filled band coupled with a third-filled band for M=Cu. Depending on electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling strengths, the ground-state phase becomes a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid or a state with a gap(s). For M=Ag, there appear a spin-gap state with a dominant 2k_F charge-density-wave correlation, a Mott insulator with a dominant 4k_F charge-density-wave correlation, or a spin-Peierls state with different magnitudes of spin and charge gaps. Three-dimensionality is taken into account by cutting off the logarithmic singularity in either the particle-particle channel or the particle-hole channel. The difference between the ground-state phase of the R_1=R_2=CH_3 salt (spin-Peierls state) and that of the R_1=R_2=I salt (antiferromagnetic state) is qualitatively explained by a difference in the cutoff energy in the particle-particle channel. For M=Cu, there appear a Mott insulator with a charge density wave of period 3 and a Peierls insulator with a charge density wave of period 6. The conditions for the experimentally observed, Mott insulator phase are strong correlation in the sixth-filled band, moderate electron-phonon couplings, and finite electron-4k_F phonon coupling. Resistance is calculated as a function of temperature with a memory-function approximation in both cases above. It qualitatively reproduces the differences among the M=Ag and M=Cu cases as well as the R_1=R_2=CH_3 and R_1=R_2=I cases.	1	6	6

The pi-N sigma-term value with its implications for nucleon quark structure and the recent controversy concerning the size of the scalar quark condensate have renewed the experimental interest in these two fundamental systems. We report new differential cross sections for the reaction $pi^-p \to \pi^0n$ at 27.5 MeV pion incident kinetic energy, measured between $\theta_{CM} = 0^\circ$ and $55^\circ$. Our results are in excellent agreement with the existing comprehensive pi-N phase shift analysis.

They are examined in the two-matrix model as well as in the three-matrix model for the case of the tricritical Ising model. Comparing these amplitudes, we demonstrate relations between degrees of freedom of matter states in the two models. We also show that they have a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of interactions of the boundaries. It plays an important role that two parts of a boundary with different matter states stick each other. We also find two closed sets of Schwinger-Dyson equations which determine disk amplitudes in the three-matrix model.	0	2	2

After introducing some general comments on the possibility of finding defects that support internal structure in two specific systems, we introduce thermal effects to show how the picture for domain walls hosting domain ribbons appears at high temperature.	0	29	27

hep-th/9706171	Axions and the Strong CP Problem in M-theory	We examine the possibility that the strong CP problem is solved by string-theoretic axions in strong-coupling limit of the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string theory (M-theory). We first discuss some generic features of gauge kinetic functions in compactified M-theory, and examine in detail the axion potential induced by the explicit breakings other than the QCD anomaly of the non-linear U(1)_{PQ} symmetries of string-theoretic axions. It is argued based on supersymmetry and discrete gauge symmetries that if the compactification radius is large enough, there can be a U(1)_{PQ}-symmetry whose breaking other than the QCD anomaly, whatever its microscopic origin is, is suppressed enough for the axion mechanism to work. Phenomenological viability of such a large radius crucially depends upon the quantized coefficients in gauge kinetic functions. We note that the large radius required for the axion mechanism is viable only in a limited class of models. For instance, for compactifications on a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold with a vanishing second E_8 field strength, it is viable only when the quantized flux of the antisymmetric tensor field in M-theory has a minimal nonzero value. It is also stressed that this large compactification radius allows the QCD axion in M-theory to be cosmologically viable in the presence of a late time entropy production.	0	87	34
hep-th/9706222	Confinement in Covariant Gauges	We examine the weak coupling limit of Euclidean SU(n) gauge theory in covariant gauges. Following an earlier suggestion, an equivariant BRST-construction is used to define the continuum theory on a finite torus. The equivariant gauge fixing introduces constant ghost fields as moduli of the model. We study the parameter- and moduli- space perturbatively. For $n_f \leq n$ quark flavors, the moduli flow to a non-trivial fixed point in certain critical covariant gauges and the one-loop effective potential indicates that the global SU(n) color symmetry of the gauge fixed model is spontaneously broken to $U(1)^{n-1}$. Ward identities and renormalization group arguments imply that the longitudinal gauge boson propagator at long range is dominated by $n(n-1)$ Goldstone bosons in these critical covariant gauges. In the large $n$ limit, we derive a nonlinear integral equation for the expectation value of large Wilson loops assuming that the exchange of Goldstone bosons dominates the interaction at long range in critical covariant gauges. We find numerically that the expectation value of large circular Wilson loops decreases exponentially with the enclosed area in the absence of dynamical fermions. The gauge invariance of this mechanism for confinement in critical covariant gauges is discussed.	0	6	1
nucl-th/9706056	Isospin Splitting in the Pion-Nucleon Couplings from QCD Sum Rules	We use QCD sum rules for the three point function of a pseudoscalar and two nucleonic currents in order to estimate the charge dependence of the pion nucleon coupling constant coming from isospin violation in the strong interaction. The effect can be attributed primarily to the difference of the quark condensates <ubar u> and <dbar d>. Assuming that the pi0 is a pure isostate we obtain for the splitting between the coupling of proton and neutron to the neutral pion an interval of [0.008 ; 0.023], the uncertainties coming mainly from the input parameters. In order to obtain the coupling to a physical pi0 we have to take pi - eta mixing into account leading to an interval of [0.012 ; 0.037]. The charged pion nucleon coupling is found to be the average of the two neutral ones. Electromagnetic effects are not included.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9707003	Evidence for a dusty warm absorber in NGC 3227 ?	We have analyzed survey and pointed \ros PSPC observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3227. Large amplitude X-ray variability is detected, with a factor $\sim$ 15 change in count rate within about 3 years. Smaller changes are seen on the timescale of days, the largest being a factor of 3.5. No strong spectral variability is found throughout the pointed observation. The X-ray spectrum is modeled in terms of warm absorption and both, a dust-free warm absorber and one with internal dust, give an excellent spectral fit. Additionally using multi-wavelength observations of NGC 3227, the dusty warm absorber is favored and suggested as an explanation for the lack of a large cold absorbing column in the soft X-ray region despite excess reddening along the line of sight. Self-consistent re-calculation of the models including Galactic-ISM-like dust results in an ionization parameter log U = -0.25 and a column density log N_w = 21.8 of the warm absorber. X-ray variability and dust survival arguments are used to constrain the density and further properties of the ionized material. The influence of dust and other parameters on the thermal stability of the warm absorber is investigated. Predictions are given for the absorber-intrinsic optical--UV line emission and absorption.	0	0	0

From the statistics collected in just 101.9 days one obtains a model independent upper bound on the antineutrino flux (for energy greater than 8.3 MeV) Phi < 9*10^4 cm^-2 s^-1 at the 95% C.L. By assuming the same energy spectrum as for the 8B neutrinos, the 95% C.L. bound is Phi < 6*10^4 cm^-2 s^-1. Within three years of data taking, the sensitivity to neutrino-antineutrino transition probability will reach the 1% level, thus providing a stringent test of hybrid oscillation models.	0	9	1
astro-ph/9707101	Expectations for the Difference Between Local and Global Measurements of the Hubble Constant	There are irreducible differences between the Hubble constant measured locally and the global value. They are due to density perturbations and finite sample volume (cosmic variance) and finite number of objects in the sample (sampling variance). We quantify these differences for a suite of COBE-normalized CDM models that are consistent with the observed large-scale structure. For small samples of objects that only extend out to 10,000 km/sec, the variance can approach 4%. For the largest samples of Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), which include about 40 objects and extend out to almost 40,000 km/sec, the variance is 1-2% and is dominated by sampling variance. Sampling and cosmic variance may be an important consideration in comparing local determinations of the Hubble constant with precision determinations of the global value that will be made from high-resolution maps of CBR anisotropy.	0	26	25

Since then, several observations have been obtained with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in order to study the radio behavior of this source in relation to its soft and hard X-ray activity. We present new results of high resolution radio observations performed with the ATCA in order to study the jet-like feature observed in GX 339-4 by Fender et al (1997). From the ATCA lightcurve at 8640 MHz, we find evidence of quenched radio emission from GX 339-4.	0	0	0

We show that quantum corrections to \rho are dominated by quantum fluctuations with wavelengths of order 1/\sqrt{\rho a}, where a is the S-wave scattering length. By expanding the equations for the Hartree-Fock approximation to second order in the gradient expansion, we derive local correction terms to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation that take into account the dominant effects of quantum fluctuations. We also show that the gradient expansion for the density breaks down at fourth order.	1	45	6
cond-mat/9707248	Equilibrium vortex-line configurations and critical currents in thin films under a parallel field	Vortex-line equilibrium configurations and critical currents for type-II superconducting films at zero-temperature are studied theoretically. The films are assumed to be of thickness less than or equal to the penetration depth, free of pinning by imperfections, and to be subjected to a magnetic field parallel to the film surfaces and to a transport current perpendicular to the field. By numerical minimization of the exact London theory energy expression, using simulated annealing techniques, the equilibrium configurations are determined with great accuracy over a wide range of fields and currents. These consist of chains of straight vortex-lines whose number depends both on the field and on the current. Transitions involving a change by one in the chain number are found to take place either if the field is increased at zero transport current or if the transport current is increased at constant field. At the transitions, there is a considerable rearrangement in the vortex-line positions and a small, discontinuous, change in their number. The equilibrium configurations with chain numbers that are not too small form a nearly perfect triangular lattice, centered with respect to the film surfaces. However, small deviations from this arrangement are found to be important in determining the behavior near the transition and when the transport current approaches the critical current. It is found that the critical current has a a non-monotonic dependence on the field. The zero-temperature equilibrium phase diagram in the field-transport current plane is reported.	1	1	0

Lett.73, 3395 (1994)] -- leading to a second-order-like noise-induced nonequilibrium phase transition which shows reentrance as a function of the (multiplicative) noise intensity $\sigma$-- is investigated beyond the white-noise assumption. Through a Markovian approximation and within a mean-field treatment it is found that -- in striking contrast with the usual behavior for equilibrium phase transitions -- for noise self-correlation time $\tau>0$, the stable phase for (diffusive) spatial coupling $D\to\infty$ is always the disordered one. Another surprising result is that a large noise "memory" also tends to destroy order. These results are supported by numerical simulations.	1	0	0

In contrary, in accelerated systems only a theory maintaining an absolute simultaneity is consistent with the natural behaviour of clocks. The principle of equivalence is discussed, and it is found that any synchronisation can be used locally in a freely falling frame. Whatever the choosen synchronisation, the first derivatives of the metric tensor disapear and a geodesic is locally a straight line. But it is shown that only a synchronisation maintaining an absolute simultaneity allows to define time consistently on circular orbits of a Schwarzschild metric. Key words: special and general relativity, synchronisation, one-way velocity of light, ether, principle of equivalence.	0	1	1

hep-ph/9707244	Slepton Production as a Probe of the Squark Mass Scale	We investigate an important radiative correction to the slepton and chargino production processes. We consider a supersymmetric spectrum with a large splitting between the squark and slepton masses. In this case, in the effective theory below the squark mass threshold, the supersymmetric Slavnov-Taylor identities which enforce the equality of the gauge and gaugino couplings are violated. The gaugino propagators receive potentially large corrections due to virtual quark/squark loop effects. We compute the full one-loop (s)quark corrected slepton production cross-sections. The t-channel one-loop scattering amplitudes are factorized into an effective chargino/neutralino mass matrix and an effective fermion-sfermion-gaugino coupling. The difference between the effective gaugino coupling and the gauge coupling is proportional to log(Msq/msl) in the large squark mass limit. We find that the one-loop corrected slepton production cross-sections can depend on the squark mass strongly, up to 9% times log(Msq/msl). We investigate the squark mass sensitivity of the slepton cross-section measurements at a future linear collider. For sneutrino production accessible at sqrt{s}= 500 GeV there can be sensitivity to squark masses at or larger than 1 TeV.	0	40	37

Due to the opposite C-parities of photon and meson M (M = eta_C, pi^0, a_2) this process probes the t-channel C=-1 odderon exchange which is described here as noninteracting three-gluon exchange. Estimates for the cross section of the inelastic diffractive process gamma^* p -> eta_C X_p are presented. The total cross section of diffractive \eta_C meson photoproduction is found to be 47 pb. The cross sections for the diffractive production of light mesons (pi^0, a_2) in \gamma^* p collisions are of the same order if the photon virtuality Q^2 is m^2_C.	0	40	36

We compare the lattice results with leading order hard thermal loop resummed perturbation theory. In the broken phase of the SU(2)+Higgs model, we show that the lattice results can be reproduced and that the lattices used are too coarse to observe some important plasmon effects. In the symmetric phase, the main qualitative features of the lattice results can also be understood. In the pure SU(2) theory, on the other hand, there are discrepancies which might point to larger Landau and plasmon damping effects than indicated by perturbation theory.	0	12	8

hep-th/9707153	Hidden Quantum Group Structure in Einstein's General Relativity	A new formal scheme is presented in which Einstein's classical theory of General Relativity appears as the common, invariant sector of a one-parameter family of different theories. This is achieved by replacing the Poincare` group of the ordinary tetrad formalism with a q-deformed Poincare` group, the usual theory being recovered at q=1. Although written in terms of noncommuting vierbein and spin-connection fields, each theory has the same metric sector leading to the ordinary Einstein-Hilbert action and to the corresponding equations of motion. The Christoffel symbols and the components of the Riemann tensor are ordinary commuting numbers and have the usual form in terms of a metric tensor built as an appropriate bilinear in the vierbeins. Furthermore we exhibit a one-parameter family of Hamiltonian formalisms for general relativity, by showing that a canonical formalism a` la Ashtekar can be built for any value of q. The constraints are still polynomial, but the Poisson brackets are not skewsymmetric for q different from 1.	0	8	5

The potential models we employ are the recent versions of the Nijmegen group, Nijm-I, Nijm-II and Reid93, the Argonne $V_{18}$ potential and the CD-Bonn potential. All these potentials yield a symmetry energy which increases with density, resolving a discrepancy that existed for older NN potentials. The origin of remaining differences is discussed.	0	38	34
astro-ph/9708019	A Vorticity-Magnetic Field Dynamo Instability	We generalize the mean field magnetic dynamo to include local evolution of the mean vorticity in addition to the mean magnetic field. The coupled equations exhibit a general mean field dynamo instability that enables the transfer of turbulent energy to the magnetic field and vorticity on larger scales. The growth of the vorticity and magnetic field both require helical turbulence which can be supplied by an underlying global rotation. The dynamo coefficients are derived including the backreaction from the mean magnetic field to lowest order. We find that a mean vorticity field can actually seed exponential growth of mean magnetic field from only a small scale seed magnetic field, without the need for a seed mean magnetic field. The equations decouple when the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field cross-correlations vanish, resulting in the separate mean field magnetic and mean field vorticity dynamo equations.	0	0	0

Our analysis includes detailed modelling of the effects of X-ray reflection/reprocessing. We have found that (1) the contribution of the reprocessed component (both continuum and line) corresponds to the solid angle of the reprocessor as seen from the X-ray source of Omega \approx (0.4-0.5) 2\pi, (2) the reprocessed component (both line and continuum) is broadened (``smeared'') by kinematic and relativistic effects, as expected from the accretion disk reflection.

cond-mat/9708037	Radial fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell: a weakly nonlinear analysis	The Saffman-Taylor viscous fingering instability occurs when a less viscous fluid displaces a more viscous one between narrowly spaced parallel plates in a Hele-Shaw cell. Experiments in radial flow geometry form fan-like patterns, in which fingers of different lengths compete, spread and split. Our weakly nonlinear analysis of the instability predicts these phenomena, which are beyond the scope of linear stability theory. Finger competition arises through enhanced growth of sub-harmonic perturbations, while spreading and splitting occur through the growth of harmonic modes. Nonlinear mode-coupling enhances the growth of these perturbations with appropriate relative phases, as we demonstrate through a symmetry analysis of the mode coupling equations. We contrast mode coupling in radial flow with rectangular flow geometry.	1	0	0

We argue that the action thus obtained describes an intermediate scale of vortex motion with phonon fluctuations of the line between the incompressible hydrodynamic r\'egime and the microscopic one dominated by roton emission and absorption. The formalism gives an accurate semiclassical picture of vortex string motion and is of relevance for the description of vortex ring quantum nucleation in a perturbation theory of the purely incompressible case.	1	2	2

The measurement was performed using a sample of 130k hadronic Z0 events, collected with the SLD at the SLC. The method utilizes the 3-D vertexing abilities of the CCD pixel vertex detector and the small stable SLC beams to obtain a high b-tagging efficiency and purity.

It reduces to the (one-body)Dirac equation in the infinite limit of one of the constituent mass. It also has the symmetries to assure the existence of the anti-bound-state with the same mass. The interaction kernel(pseudo-potential) is systematically constructed by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of the background field theory, by which the retardation effects are included in the interaction. Its wave function at the origin(WFO) behaves properly in a manner suggested by the covariant field theory. The equation can well be applied in the heavy quark effective theory. It can also be used as a starting equation for the unperturbed system in the rigorous perturbation theory of QED.	0	1	0
hep-ph/9708303	Primordial magnetic fields, anomalous isocurvature fluctuations and Big Bang nucleosynthesis	We show that the presence of primordial stochastic (hypercharge) magnetic fields before the electroweak (EW) phase transition induces isocurvature fluctuations (baryon number inhomogeneities). Depending on the details of the magnetic field spectrum and on the particle physics parameters (such as the strength of the EW phase transition and electron Yukawa couplings) these fluctuations may survive until the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Their lenghtscale may exceed the neutron diffusion length at that time, while their magnitude can be so large that sizable antimatter domains are present. This provides the possibility of a new type of initial conditions for non-homogeneous BBN or, from a more conservative point of view, stringent bounds on primordial magnetic fields.	0	87	38

The expression for the Euler characteristic, through the Gauss-Bonnet integral, and the one for the entropy of gravitational instantons are proposed in a form that makes the relation between them self-evident. A new formulation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, where the entropy and the Euler characteristic are related by $S=\chi A/8$, is obtained. This formula provides the correct results for a wide class of gravitational instantons described by both spherically and axially symmetric metrics.	0	24	8
physics/9708004	Generalized Morse Potential: Symmetry and Satellite Potentials	We study in detail the bound state spectrum of the generalized Morse potential~(GMP), which was proposed by Deng and Fan as a potential function for diatomic molecules. By connecting the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation with the Laplace equation on the hyperboloid and the Schr\"odinger equation for the P\"oschl-Teller potential, we explain the exact solvability of the problem by an $so(2,2)$ symmetry algebra, and obtain an explicit realization of the latter as $su(1,1) \oplus su(1,1)$. We prove that some of the $so(2,2)$ generators connect among themselves wave functions belonging to different GMP's (called satellite potentials). The conserved quantity is some combination of the potential parameters instead of the level energy, as for potential algebras. Hence, $so(2,2)$ belongs to a new class of symmetry algebras. We also stress the usefulness of our algebraic results for simplifying the calculation of Frank-Condon factors for electromagnetic transitions between rovibrational levels based on different electronic states.	0	14	4

We provide an explicit algorithm for generating any prescribed interference pattern with an arbitrary precision.	0	85	78

With dispersive phase shifters the ratio of the coherence length to wavelength limits the numbers that can be factored. A conservative estimate permits $N \approx 10^7$.

As an application, we derive recursive formulas for the number of such curves when the number is finite. These recursive formulas require as ``seed data'' only one input: there is one line in P^1 through two points. These numbers can be seen as top intersection products of various cycles on the Hilbert scheme of degree d rational or elliptic curves in P^n, or on certain components of $\mbar_0(P^n,d)$ or $\mbar_1(P^n,d)$, and as such give information about the Chow ring (and hence the topology) of these objects. The formula can also be interpreted as an equality in the Chow ring (not necessarily at the top level) of the appropriate Hilbert scheme or space of stable maps. In particular, this gives an algorithm for counting rational and elliptic curves in P^n intersecting various fixed general linear spaces.

cond-mat/9709034	Pseudogap phase formation in the crossover from Bose-Einstein condensation to BCS superconductivity	A phase diagram for a 2D metal with variable carrier density has been derived. It consists of a normal phase, where the order parameter is absent; a so-called ``abnormal normal'' phase where this parameter is also absent but the mean number of composite bosons (bound pairs) exceeds the mean number of free fermions; a pseudogap phase where the absolute value of the order parameter gradually increases but its phase is a random value, and finally a superconducting (here Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) phase. The characteristic transition temperatures between these phases are found. The chemical potential and paramagnetic susceptibility behavior as functions of the fermion density and the temperature are also studied. An attempt is made to qualitatively compare the resulting phase diagram with the features of underdoped high-$T_{c}$ superconducting compounds above their critical temperature.	1	24	11
cond-mat/9709139	Scaling and criticality of the Kondo effect in a Luttinger liquid	A quantum Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed and applied to study the critical behavior of a single Kondo impurity in a Luttinger liquid. This numerically exact method has no finite-size limitations and allows to simulate the whole temperature range. Focusing on the impurity magnetic susceptibility, we determine the scaling functions, in particular for temperatures well below the Kondo temperature. In the absence of elastic potential scattering, we find Fermi-liquid behavior for strong electron-electron interactions, g_c < 1/2, and anomalous power laws for 1/2<g_c < 1, where g_c is the correlation parameter of the Luttinger liquid. These findings resolve a recent controversy. If elastic potential scattering is present, we find a logarithmically divergent impurity susceptibility at g_c<1/2 which can be rationalized in terms of the two-channel Kondo model.	1	14	9

A total of 120 W-pair candidates has been selected in the q q(bar) q q(bar), q q(bar) l nu(bar)_l, and l nu(bar)_l l(bar)' nu_l' decay channels, for an integrated luminosity of 10.4 pb^-1. We use these data to determine several different anomalous coupling parameters using the measured cross-section and the distributions of kinematic variables. We measure alpha_B-phi = 0.35 + 1.29 - 1.07 +/- 0.38, alpha_W-phi = 0.00 + 0.30 - 0.28 +/- 0.11, alpha_W = 0.18 + 0.49 - 0.47 +/- 0.23, Delta(g_1^z) = -0.03 + 0.40 -0.37 +/- 0.14, Delta(kappa_gamma^(HISZ)) = 0.03 + 0.55 - 0.51 +/- 0.20, and Delta(kappa) = 0.03 + 0.49 - 0.46 +/- 0.21. Combining the alpha_W-phi result with our previous result obtained from the 161 GeV data sample we measure alpha_W-phi = -0.08 + 0.28 - 0.25 +/- 0.10.

hep-ph/9709232	Non-Perturbative Quantum Dynamics of a New Inflation Model	We consider an O(N) model coupled self-consistently to gravity in the semiclassical approximation, where the field is subject to `new inflation' type initial conditions. We study the dynamics self-consistently and non-perturbatively with non-equilibrium field theory methods in the large N limit. We find that spinodal instabilities drive the growth of non-perturbatively large quantum fluctuations which shut off the inflationary growth of the scale factor. We find that a very specific combination of these large fluctuations plus the inflaton zero mode assemble into a new effective field. This new field behaves classically and it is the object which actually rolls down. We show how this reinterpretation saves the standard picture of how metric perturbations are generated during inflation and that the spinodal growth of fluctuations dominates the time dependence of the Bardeen variable for superhorizon modes during inflation. We compute the amplitude and index for the spectrum of scalar density and tensor perturbations and argue that in all models of this type the spinodal instabilities are responsible for a `red' spectrum of primordial scalar density perturbations. A criterion for the validity of these models is provided and contact with the reconstruction program is established validating some of the results within a non-perturbative framework. The decoherence aspects and the quantum to classical transition through inflation are studied in detail by following the full evolution of the density matrix and relating the classicality of cosmological perturbations to that of long-wavelength matter fluctuations.	0	85	44

We find that that such an effective field theory provides a better fit to data than the standard model (the chi-squared per degree of freedom is half as large). We examine in some detail an illustrative model where the exchange of heavy scalars produces the correct type of non-standard couplings.	0	26	23

For the light quark mass we find m_light(2 GeV) = 2.7(2) MeV, which is lower than in quenched simulations. Applying a new method, which we propose to extract the strange quark mass in a sea of two dynamical light quarks, we obtain m_strange(2 GeV) = 140(20) MeV.	0	0	0

It is shown that electromagnetic decays of these mesons may give an important contribution to the observed yields of dileptons. Mass spectra of positron-electron and muon pairs produced in central Au+Au collisions are calculated under some simplifying assumptions on the space-time variation of the baryonic current in a nuclear collision process. Comparison with the CERES data for 160 AGev Pb+Au collisions shows that the proposed mechanism gives a noticeable fraction of the observed lepton pairs in the intermediate region of invariant masses. Sensitivity of the dilepton yield to the in-medium modification of masses and widths of vector mesons is demonstrated.	0	3	0

Since non-minimal fields are generic after renormalisation in curved spacetime, this offers a new paradigm in reheating - one which naturally allows for efficient production of the massive bosons needed for GUT baryogenesis. We also show that both vector and tensor fields are produced resonantly during reheating, extending the previously known correspondences between bosonic fields of different spins during preheating.	0	60	34

We have studied in detail the origin and consequences of this dispersion relation for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos both in a toy model with only neutral currents and a single neutrino flavour and in a realistic ``Standard Model'' with two neutrino flavours. For a range of neutrino momenta near the minimum of the dispersion relation, Dirac neutrinos are trapped by their coherent interactions with the medium.

We discuss how the various branches of this theory arise in the string/M theory brane configurations and compare our results with the ones obtained earlier by Intriligator and Seiberg in the context of field theory. In the M theory approach, we explain the various branches from the asymptotic position of semi-infinite D4 branes in the $w=x^8+i x^9$ direction, which is closely related to the eigenvalues of the meson matrix $M^{ij} = Q^{i}_a Q^{j}_a$ where $Q^{i}_a$ is a squark multiplet ( $i=1, \cdots, 2N_f$ and $ a=1, \cdots, N_c$).In M theory, these branches are explained by observing a new phenomena which did not occur for the gauge groups SU(N_c) or Sp(N_c).	0	21	21

The soliton solutions are then obtained as elements of the orbits of the dressing transformations constructed in terms of representations of the vertex operators of the affine $sl (n)$ algebras realized in the unconventional gradations. Such soliton solutions exhibit non-trivial dependence on the KdV (odd) time flows and KP (odd and even) time flows which distinguishes them from the conventional structure of the Darboux-B\"{a}cklund Wronskian solutions of the constrained KP hierarchy.	0	6	1

astro-ph/9710232	Soft X-ray Scattering and Halos from Dust	Small angle scatterings of X-rays by interstellar dust particles create halos around x-ray sources. By observing these halos with sufficient angular resolution it is possible to derive information about both the spatial distribution of the dust along the line of sight to the source and some of the physical properties of the scattering dust particles. Previous analyses of halos have been used to infer that the scattering dust particles must be fluffy. These fluffy dust particles have also been suggested as a possible solution to the interstellar carbon "crisis." This crisis results from the discrepancy between the available ISM carbon abundance and the amount required to be in dust to account for the average ISM extinction. Dwek (1997), however, pointed out that fluffy dust particles may not solve the carbon crisis. In light of this, we re-examine the evidence for fluffy dust in the ISM from x-ray scattering data. We find that previous studies overestimated the intensity of the halos by using the RG approximation, which fails for energies below 1 keV. Using the exact Mie solution we find that below 1 keV the scattering becomes much less efficient. Applying the Mie calculations to the x-ray halo observed around Nova Cygni 1992, we conclude that the data can be explained by scattering from regular dust, and does not require interstellar dust particles to be fluffy.	0	54	54
chao-dyn/9710012	Periodic orbit quantization of the Sinai billiard in the small scatterer limit	We consider the semiclassical quantization of the Sinai billiard for disk radii R small compared to the wave length 2 pi/k. Via the application of the periodic orbit theory of diffraction we derive the semiclassical spectral determinant. The limitations of the derived determinant are studied by comparing it to the exact KKR determinant, which we generalize here for the A_1 subspace. With the help of the Ewald resummation method developed for the full KKR determinant we transfer the complex diffractive determinant to a real form. The real zeros of the determinant are the quantum eigenvalues in semiclassical approximation. The essential parameter is the strength of the scatterer c=J_0(kR)/Y_0(kR). Surprisingly, this can take any value between plus and minus infinity within the range of validity of the diffractive approximation kR <<4. We study the statistics exhibited by spectra for fixed values of c. It is Poissonian for |c|=infinity, provided the disk is placed inside a rectangle whose sides obeys some constraints. For c=0 we find a good agreement of the level spacing distribution with GOE, whereas the form factor and two-point correlation function are similar but exhibit larger deviations. By varying the parameter c from 0 to infinity the level statistics interpolates smoothly between these limiting cases.	0	0	0

The interplay of dissipation, inertia and elasticity is shown to control the qualitative thermodynamical behavior and their relative amount determines two very distinct regimes for the specific heat.

Consistently with the Dirac mass texture of the quark sector realizing the CKM mixing, this naturally explains the recent experimental results on both the atmospheric neutrino anomaly observed by the Superkamiokande collaboration and the solar neutrino problem. In this texture the right-handed Majorana mass of the third generation is of the order of GUT scale, which is favorable for reproducing the observed bottom-tau mass ratio.	0	48	48
hep-ph/9710536	Search for the scalar a_0 and f_0 mesons in the φradiative decays	The potentialities of the production of the $a_0$ and $f_0$ mesons in the $\phi$ radiative decays are considered based on a new two-channel analysis of the $\pi\pi$ scattering in a energy region near 1 GeV. We predict $BR(\phi\to\gamma f_0(980))\sim10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ that is a great value for the decay forbidden by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule. We discuss the four-quark, $K\bar K$-molecule and two-quark scenarios for the $a_0$ and $f_0$ mesons. It is presented arguments that the $e^+e^-$-colliders and especially the $\phi$ factories give the possibility to choose a single one out of them.	0	0	0

Several new examples of surfaces of revolution associated with well-known solvable cases of the Schoedinger equation (infinite well, harmonic oscillator, Coulomb potential, Bargmann potential, etc.) are analyzed and visualized. The properties of such surfaces are discussed. Two types of deformations (evolutions), namely 1) preserving the Gaussian curvature and 2) via the dynamics of the Korteweg-de-Vries equation are discussed.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9711052	Bow-shock induced star formation in the LMC?	The structure of supergiant shells, in particular of LMC 4, is hard to explain with stochastic self-propagating star formation. A series of supergiant structures lies along the outer edge of the LMC and form a sequence increasing clockwise in age. We have considered the rotation of the LMC and its motion through the halo of the Milky Way and propose that these structures find their origin in star formation induced in the bow-shock formed at the leading edge of the LMC. Due to the rotation of the LMC these structures then move aside.	0	38	38
astro-ph/9711102	Cosmology with a Primordial Scaling Field	A weakly coupled scalar field $\Phi$ with a simple exponential potential $V=M_P^4\exp(-\lambda\Phi/M_P)$ where $M_P$ is the reduced Planck mass, and $\lambda > 2$, has an attractor solution in a radiation or matter dominated universe in which it mimics the scaling of the dominant component, contributing a fixed fraction $\Omega_\phi$ (determined by $\lambda$) to the energy density. Such fields arise generically in particle physics theories involving compactified dimensions, with values of $\lambda$ which give a cosmologically relevant $\Omega_\phi$. For natural initial conditions on the scalar field in the early universe the attractor solution is established long before the epoch of structure formation, and in contrast to the solutions used in other scalar field cosmologies, it is one which does not involve an energy scale for the scalar field characteristic of late times . We study in some detail the evolution of matter and radiation perturbations in a standard inflation-motivated $\Omega=1$ dark-matter dominated cosmology with this extra field. Using a full Einstein-Boltzmann calculation we compare observable quantities with current data. We find that, for $\Omega_\phi\simeq 0.08-0.12$, these models are consistent with large angle cosmic microwave background anisotropies as detected by COBE, the linear mass variance as compiled from galaxy surveys, big bang nucleosynthesis, the abundance of rich clusters and constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ systems at high redshift. Given the simplicity of the model, its theoretical motivation and its success in matching observations, we argue that it should be taken on a par with other currently viable models of structure formation.	0	576	355
astro-ph/9711259	The Structure and Dynamics of Cold Dark Matter Halos	We investigate the internal structure of cold dark matter halos using high resolution N-body simulations. As the mass and force resolution are increased, halo density profiles become steeper, asymptoting to a slope of $\sim -4/3$ in the central regions and may not have converged to a unique result. At our highest resolution we have nearly 3 million particles within the virial radius, $R_{200}$, and force softening that is $\sim 0.2% R_{200}$. This resolution has also allowed us to resolve a large part of the overmerging problem - we find over 1000 surviving dark halos orbiting within a single cluster potential. These data have given us unprecedented insights into the dynamics and structure of ``halos within halos'', allowing us for the first time, to compare the distribution of dark matter with observations of galaxies in clusters.	0	4	4

These data significantly increase the fraction of bright RGB objects with classifications. Specifically, we report and discuss the classification of 66 radio-loud quasars, 53 BL Lacs, 33 Broad Line Radio Galaxies, 5 Narrow Line Radio Galaxies, 1 Seyfert I galaxy and 11 galaxies or galaxies in clusters. Over 78% of the identifications we present here are new. The observations we report were undertaken as part of our targeted search program to identify a new, large unbiased sample of BL Lac Objects and we therefore discuss the BL Lac sample extensively. Unlike many previous surveys, we impose no selection criteria based on optical morphology, color or broadband spectral energy distribution. Our classifications are based solely on a carefully defined set of self-consistent spectroscopic classification criteria. We show the 53 RGB presented here exhibit transitional properties between normal galaxies and BL Lacs discovered previously. We show there is no clear separation in CaII break strength between RGB BL Lacs and galaxies, with the distribution of break strengths varying smoothly between 0% and 50%. We also show that the newly discovered RGB BL Lacs reside in a "zone of avoidance" in the log(S_x/S_r) vs. log(S_o/S_r) diagram. This has important implications for BL Lac search strategies since it shows that RASS BL Lac samples will be severely incomplete if candidates are chosen only from among those objects with the highest S_x/S_r flux ratios.	0	3	3

Starting from the t-J model, we derive the classical equation governing the motion of the charged wall by using a ficticious spin model as an intermediate step. A wave-like equation of motion is obtained and the wall elasticity and mass density constants are derived in terms of the t and J parameters. The wall is then regarded as an elastic string which will be trapped by the pinning potential produced by randomly distributed impurities. We evaluate the pinning potential and estimate the threshold electric field which has to be applied to the system in order to release the walls. Besides, the dynamics of the stripe in the presence of a bias field below the threshold is considered and the high- and low-temperature relaxation rates are derived.	1	0	0

Solitons are shown to form from dark interference fringes when the soliton structure, constrained in a defined manner, has lower energy than the interference fringe and an analytic expression is given for this condition.	1	3	0

cond-mat/9711302	Driven Lattice Gases with Quenched Disorder: Exact Results and Different Macroscopic Regimes	We study the effect of quenched spatial disorder on the steady states of driven systems of interacting particles. Two sorts of models are studied: disordered drop-push processes and their generalizations, and the disordered asymmetric simple exclusion process. We write down the exact steady-state measure, and consequently a number of physical quantities explicitly, for the drop-push dynamics in any dimensions for arbitrary disorder. We find that three qualitatively different regimes of behaviour are possible in 1-$d$ disordered driven systems. In the Vanishing-Current regime, the steady-state current approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. A system with a non-zero current can either be in the Homogeneous regime, chracterized by a single macroscopic density, or the Segregated-Density regime, with macroscopic regions of different densities. We comment on certain important constraints to be taken care of in any field theory of disordered systems.	1	2	2
gr-qc/9711024	Mass inflation inside non-Abelian black holes	The interior geometry of static, spherically symmetric black holes of the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is analyzed. It is found that in contrast to the Abelian case generically no inner (Cauchy) horizon is formed inside non-Abelian black holes. Instead the solutions come close to a Cauchy horizon but then undergo an enormous growth of the mass function, a phenomenon which can be termed `mass inflation' in analogy to what is observed for perturbations of the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m solution. A significant difference between the theories with and without a Higgs field is observed. Without a Higgs field the YM field induces repeated cycles of massinflation -- taking the form of violent `explosions' -- interrupted by quiescent periods and subsequent approaches to an almost Cauchy horizon. With the Higgs field no such cycles occur. Besides the generic solutions there are non-generic families with a Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m and a pseudo Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m type singularity at $r=0$.	0	6	4

The model gives proton and neutron charge radii in approximate agreement with the empirical results assuming reasonable values for the radii of the constituent quarks.	0	11	8

We show that, if neutrino conversions within the Sun result in partial polarization of initial solar neutrino fluxes, then a new opportunity arises to observe the electron antineutrinos and thus to probe the Majorana nature of the neutrinos. This is achieved by comparing the slopes of the energy dependence of the differential neutrino electron scattering cross section for different neutrino conversion scenarios. We also show how the \nu_e -> \bar{\nu}_e conversions may take place for low energy solar neutrinos while being unobservable at the Kamiokande and Super-Kamiokande experiments.	0	18	17

A similar allegation has been made concerning our proof of the gauge independence of the sum of the ghost number and Lagrange multiplier anomalies in non-conformal gauges. In this short note we refute their criticism by explaining the simple logic of our proofs and emphasizing the points that have been missed by Abe and Nakanishi.	0	0	0

We present the twisted superfield formalism which makes duality transformations transparent. We propose a scheme which uniquely fixes all the contact terms. We derive a formula for the correlation functions of $p$-observables on the manifolds of generalized simple type for $0 \leq p \leq 4$ and on some manifolds with $b_{2}^{+} =1$. We study the theories with matter and explore the properties of universal instanton. We also discuss the compactifications of higher dimensional theories.

Starting with the elliptic functional equations of Klumper and Pearce, we derive the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations of Zamolodchikov. Although this systematic approach, in principle, allows TBA equations to be derived for all the excited states we restrict our attention here to the largest eigenvalue or groundstate in Regimes III and IV. In Regime III the TBA equations are massive while in Regime IV there is massless scattering describing the renormalization group flow between distinct A_1^{(1)} coset conformal field theories. Regimes I and II, pertaining to Z_{L-1} parafermions, will be treated in a subsequent paper.	0	16	15
nucl-th/9711019	Strong Coupling Improved Equilibration In High Energy Nuclear Collisions	In high energy nuclear collisions, most calculations on the early equilibration of the parton plasma showed that the system does not come close to full equilibrium, especially for the fermion components. However, since the system is constantly evolving, the cooling effect due to expansion will lead to a decrease of the average parton energies. So the interactions should be enhanced by a corresponding increase of the running coupling. We show that this leads to a faster and improved equilibration. This improvement is more important for the fermions compensating partially for their weaker interactions and slower equilibration.	0	0	0

As a result, the spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies changes by 0.3-05%, depending on the angular scale, and the amplitude of the mass fluctuations on scales below about 100 h^{-1} Mpc decreases by about 0.2-0.3%.	0	48	32
astro-ph/9712211	The galactic dynamo effect due to Parker-shearing instability of magnetic flux tubes. III. The fast dynamo model	We present a new fast dynamo model for galactic magnetic fields, which is based on the Parker-shearing instability and magnetic reconnection, in the spirit of the model proposed by Parker (1992). We introduce a new scenario of flux tube interactions and estimate the dynamo transport coefficient basing on simple geometrical arguments. The obtained expressions are equivalent to the formally derived helicity $\alpha_d$ and diffusivity $\eta_d$ in the first paper of this series. The model we propose predicts that the $\alpha$-effect in galactic discs has opposite sign with respect to that resulting directly from the sign of the Coriolis force. We estimate the rate of magnetic heating due to the reconnection of magnetic flux tubes, which plays an important role in our dynamo model. The corresponding luminosities of the diffuse X-ray emission are consistent with the ROSAT observations of nearby galaxies. The present considerations synthesize the ideas of Parker with our own results presented in the preceding papers (Hanasz & Lesch 1993, 1997; Hanasz 1997).	0	0	0
astro-ph/9712327	Broadening of the Iron emission line in MCG-6-30-15 by Comptonization	We show that the Iron K emission line from MCG-6-30-15 could be broadened due to Comptonization by a surrounding highly ionized cloud with radius $\sim 10^{14}$ cms. We calculate the temperature of the cloud to be $\sim0.21\kev$, provided a reasonable estimate of the UV flux is made. The X-ray/$\gamma$-ray emission observed from the source is compatible with this model. Such a cloud should be highly ionized and strong absorption edges are not expected from the source (Fabian et al 1995). For a $\onlyten{6}\msol$ black hole the size of the could corresponds to about 300 Schwarzschild radius. The intrinsic line could then be emitted far from the black hole and gravitational red-shift and Doppler effects would be negligible. If the black hole mass is much larger than $\onlyten{6}\msol$, gravitational/Doppler red-shifts would also contribute significantly to the broadening. We argue that the broad red wing observed in the source does not by itself imply emission from regions close ($R < 5 r_s$) to the black hole. However, Comptonization cannot produce a double peak. The presence of such a feature is a clear sign of inner disk emission influenced by gravitational and Doppler effects, perhaps broadened by the Comptonization. We note that simultaneous broad band (2-100 keV) study of this source can also reveal (or rule out) the presence of such a Comptonizing cloud.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9712341	The X-ray background and the ROSAT Deep Surveys	In this article we review the measurements and understanding of the X-ray background (XRB), discovered by Giacconi and collaborators 35 years ago. We start from the early history and the debate whether the XRB is due to a single, homogeneous physical process or to the summed emission of discrete sources, which was finally settled by COBE and ROSAT. We then describe in detail the progress from ROSAT deep surveys and optical identifications of the faint X-ray source population. In particular we discuss the role of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as dominant contributors for the XRB, and argue that so far there is no need to postulate a hypothesized new population of X-ray sources. The recent advances in the understanding of X-ray spectra of AGN is reviewed and a population synthesis model, based on the unified AGN schemes, is presented. This model is so far the most promising to explain all observational constraints. Future sensitive X-ray surveys in the harder X-ray band will be able to unambiguously test this picture.	0	3	3
cond-mat/9712115	Self-organized criticality as an absorbing-state phase transition	We explore the connection between self-organized criticality and phase transitions in models with absorbing states. Sandpile models are found to exhibit criticality only when a pair of relevant parameters - dissipation epsilon and driving field h - are set to their critical values. The critical values of epsilon and h are both equal to zero. The first is due to the absence of saturation (no bound on energy) in the sandpile model, while the second result is common to other absorbing-state transitions. The original definition of the sandpile model places it at the point (epsilon=0, h=0+): it is critical by definition. We argue power-law avalanche distributions are a general feature of models with infinitely many absorbing configurations, when they are subject to slow driving at the critical point. Our assertions are supported by simulations of the sandpile at epsilon=h=0 and fixed energy density (no drive, periodic boundaries), and of the slowly-driven pair contact process. We formulate a field theory for the sandpile model, in which the order parameter is coupled to a conserved energy density, which plays the role of an effective creation rate.	1	84	66
cond-mat/9712164	Phenomenology of the Interest Rate Curve	This paper contains a phenomenological description of the whole U.S. forward rate curve (FRC), based on an data in the period 1990-1996. We find that the average FRC (measured from the spot rate) grows as the square-root of the maturity, with a prefactor which is comparable to the spot rate volatility. This suggests that forward rate market prices include a risk premium, comparable to the probable changes of the spot rate between now and maturity, which can be understood as a `Value-at-Risk' type of pricing. The instantaneous FRC however departs form a simple square-root law. The distortion is maximum around one year, and reflects the market anticipation of a local trend on the spot rate. This anticipated trend is shown to be calibrated on the past behaviour of the spot itself. We show that this is consistent with the volatility `hump' around one year found by several authors (and which we confirm). Finally, the number of independent components needed to interpret most of the FRC fluctuations is found to be small. We rationalize this by showing that the dynamical evolution of the FRC contains a stabilizing second derivative (line tension) term, which tends to suppress short scale distortions of the FRC. This shape dependent term could lead, in principle, to arbitrage. However, this arbitrage cannot be implemented in practice because of transaction costs. We suggest that the presence of transaction costs (or other market `imperfections') is crucial for model building, for a much wider class of models becomes eligible to represent reality.	1	14	4
cond-mat/9712228	Coherent pairing states for the Hubbard model	We consider the Hubbard model and its extensions on bipartite lattices. We define a dynamical group based on the $\eta$-pairing operators introduced by C.N.Yang, and define coherent pairing states, which are combinations of eigenfunctions of $\eta$-operators. These states permit exact calculations of numerous physical properties of the system, including energy, various fluctuations and correlation functions, including pairing ODLRO to all orders. This approach is complementary to BCS, in that these are superconducting coherent states associated with the exact model, although they are not eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.	1	1	0

The precisely measured muon decay parameters can constrain a product of R-parity violating couplings: |\lambda_{232}\lambda_{131}| < 0.022 at the 90% CL, which is complementary to the previous limits obtained by the e-\mu universality in \tau decay.	0	5	5

Nontrivial terms arise at order v/r^8 and v^3/r^8 which are proportional to the angular momentum of the membrane state. The effective potential for a graviton moving in a boosted Kerr-type metric is computed and shown to agree precisely with the Matrix theory calculation at leading order in the long-distance expansion for each power of the graviton velocity. This result generalizes to arbitrary order; we show that terms in the membrane-graviton potential corresponding to nth moments of the membrane stress-energy tensor are reproduced correctly to all orders in the long-distance expansion by terms of the form F^4 X^n in the one-loop Matrix theory calculation.	0	19	19

The absolute cohomology is obtained by an independent method based on homological algebra. For vanishing momentum, the relative and absolute cohomologies both display a picture dependence -- a phenomenon discovered recently also in the relative Ramond sector of N=1 strings by Berkovits and Zwiebach.	0	11	11

The multiple Bailey sum amounts to an extension corresponding to the case of a nonreduced root system of certain summation identities associated to the reduced root systems that were recently conjectured by Aomoto and Ito and proved by Macdonald. By truncation, we obtain multidimensional analogues of the very-well-poised unilateral (basic) hypergeometric Rogers ${}_6\phi_5$ and Dougall ${}_5F_4$ sums (both nonterminating and terminating). The terminating sums may be used to arrive at product formulas for the norms of recently introduced ($q$-)Racah polynomials in several variables.	0	0	0

nucl-th/9712027	Medium dependence of the bag constant in the quark-meson coupling model	Possible variations of the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model are examined in which the bag constant decreases in the nuclear medium. The reduction is supposed to depend on either the mean scalar field or the effective mass of the nucleon. It is shown that the electric and magnetic radii of the bound nucleon are almost linearly correlated with the bag constant. Using the fact that the size of the bound nucleon inside a nucleus is strongly constrained by $y$-scaling data in quasielastic, electron-nucleus scattering, we set a limit for the reduction allowed in the bag constant for these two models. The present study implies that the bag constant can decrease up to 10--17 % at average nuclear density, depending on the details of the model.	0	27	19

Our results show that a small value of the zero-energy cross section is rather unlikely. In He3(He3,2p)He4 we study the effects of a possible virtual state on the cross section. Although, we have found no indication for such a state so far, its existence cannot be ruled out yet. We calculate the He3(He3,2p)He4 and H3(H3,2n)He4 cross sections in a continuum-discretized coupled channel approximation, and find a good general agreement with the data.	0	5	4

While the weak $\Delta$I=3/2 matrix elements of baryons with pseudoscalar mesons are known to be very small, the same matrix elements of baryons with vector mesons, evaluated in the factorization approximation, are found to be significant. Within the uncertainties of the factorization approximation we find that the total rate increases by at most 6% lying within the error bars of the more recent experimental result. The neutron- to proton-induced rate, on the other hand, can change by up to a factor of two, while the asymmetry parameter is strongly affected as well.	0	1	1
solv-int/9712017	Transformations of Quadrilateral Lattices	Motivated by the classical studies on transformations of conjugate nets, we develop the general geometric theory of transformations of their discrete analogues: the multidimensional quadrilateral lattices, i.e. lattices x: Z^N -> R^M, whose elementary quadrilaterals are planar. Our investigation is based on the discrete analogue of the theory of the rectilinear congruences, which we also present in detail. We study, in particular, the discrete analogues of the Laplace, Combescure, Levy, radial and fundamental transformations and their interrelations. The composition of these transformations and their permutability is also investigated from a geometric point of view. The deep connections between "transformations" and "discretizations" is also investigated for quadrilateral lattices. We finally interpret these results within the D-bar formalism.	0	51	8

hep-ph/9706515	Infra-Red Finite Charge Propagation	The Coulomb gauge has a long history and many uses. It is especially useful in bound state applications. An important feature of this gauge is that the matter fields have an infra-red finite propagator in an on-shell renormalisation scheme. This is, however, only the case if the renormalisation point is chosen to be the static point on the mass shell, p = (m, 0, 0, 0). In this letter we show how to extend this key property of the Coulomb gauge to an arbitrary relativistic renormalisation point. This is achieved through the introduction of a new class of gauges of which the Coulomb gauge is a limiting case. A physical explanation for this result is given.	0	5	2

Assuming the existence of a dyon with non-supersymmetric Kerr-Schild structure, we calculate its gravitational and electromagnetic fields and compute its mass and angular momentum to obtain a modified B.P.S. relation. The contributionn of the angular momentum to the mass appears in the condition for the appearance of a horizon.	0	0	0

We demonstrate that the QHE is replaced by conductance fluctuations due to EC backscattering in the contact arms, which leads to a fluctuating current redistribution between a dissipative bulk electron system and a less-dissipative EC-system. Both electron systems are located in different valleys of the band structure. The linear increase of Rxx with the magnetic field is explained by EC-backscattering in the Hall bar	1	0	0

astro-ph/9707233	Does the momentum flux generated by gravitational contraction drive AGB mass-loss?	Gravitational contraction always generates a radially directed momentum flux. A particularly simple example occurs in the electron-degenerate cores of AGB stars, which contract steadily under the addition of helium ashes from shell hydrogen burning. The resulting momentum flux is quantified here. And since the cores of AGB stars lack efficient momentum cancellation mechanisms, they can maintain equilibrium by exporting their excess momentum flux to the stellar envelope, which disposes of much of it in a low velocity wind. Gravitational contraction easily accounts for the momentum flux in the solar wind, as well as the flux required to lift mass into the dust formation zone of every AGB star, whereon radiation pressure continues its ejection as a low velocity wind. This mechanism explains the dependence of the AGB mass-loss rate on core mass; its generalization to objects with angular momentum and/or strong magnetic fields suggests a novel explanation of why most planetary nebulae and proto planetary nebulae exhibit axial symmetry. Quasistatic contraction is inherently biased to the generation of the maximum possible momentum flux. Its formalism is therefore readily adapted to providing an upper limit to the momentum flux needed to sustain mass loss when this begins from a semi-continuous rather than impulsive process.	0	0	0

By using the Toda criterion of the Gaussian curvature we find a classical chaos-order transition as a function of the Higgs vacuum, the Yang-Mills coupling constant and the energy of the system. Then, we study the nearest-neighbour spacing distribution of the energy levels, which shows a Wigner-Poisson transition by increasing the value of the Higgs field in the vacuum. This transition is a clear quantum signature of the classical chaos-order transition of the system.	0	6	0
cond-mat/9707235	Impurity scattering in a d-wave superconductor	The influence of (non-magnetic and magnetic) impurities on the transition temperature of a d-wave superconductor is studied anew within the framework of BCS theory. Pairing interaction decreases linearly with the impurity concentration. Accordingly $T_{c}$ suppression is proportional to the (potential or exchange) scattering rate, $1/\tau$, due to impurities. The initial slope versus $1/\tau$ is found to depend on the superconductor contrary to Abrikosov-Gor'kov type theory. Near the critical impurity concentration $T_{c}$ drops abruptly to zero. Because the potential scattering rate is generally much larger than the exchange scattering rate, magnetic impurities will also act as non-magnetic impurities as far as the $T_{c}$ decrease is concerned. The implication for the impurity doping effect in high $T_{c}$ superconductors is also discussed.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9709163	The su(N) XX model	The natural su(N) generalization of the XX model is introduced and analyzed. It is defined in terms of the characterizing properties of the usual XX model: the existence of two infinite sequences of mutually commuting conservation laws and the existence of two infinite sequences of mastersymmetries. The integrability of these models, which cannot be obtained in a degenerate limit of the su(N)-XXZ model, is established in two ways: by exhibiting their R matrix and from a direct construction of the commuting conservation laws. We then diagonalize the conserved laws by the method of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. The resulting spectrum is trivial in a certain sense; this provides another indication that the su(N) XX model is the natural generalization of the su(2) model. The application of these models to the construction of an integrable ladder, that is, an su(N) version of the Hubbard model, is mentioned.	1	14	2

By comparing the measured linear diameters of these nearby systems with the inferred diameters of a sample of more than 3000 spirals with known redshifts, we conclude that the most likely value of the Hubble Parameter lies in the range 50 - 55 km/s Mpc^{-1}.	0	0	0

astro-ph/9711356	Two serendipitous low-mass LMC clusters discovered with HST	We present V and I photometry of two open clusters in the LMC down to V ~ 26. The clusters were imaged with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera - 2 on board of the Hubble Space Telescope, as part of the Medium Deep Survey Key-Project. Both are low luminosity (Mv ~ -3.5), low mass systems (M ~ 10^3 Msolar). The chance discovery of these two clusters in two parallel WFPC2 fields suggests a significant incompleteness in the LMC cluster census near the bar. One of the clusters is roughly elliptical and compact, with a steep light profile, a central surface brightness Mu_v(0) 20.2 mag/arcsec2, half-light radius Rhl ~ 0.9 pc (total visual major diameter D ~ 3 pc) and an estimated mass M ~ 1500 Msolar. From the colour-magnitude diagram and isochrone fits we estimate its age as t ~ 2-5 10^8 years. Its mass function has a fitted slope of Gamma = \Delta log \phi (M) / \Delta log M = -1.8 +/- 0.7 in the range probed (0.9 < M/Msolar < 4.5). The other cluster is more irregular and sparser, having shallower density and surface brightness profiles. We obtain Gamma = -1.2 +/- 0.4, and estimate its mass as M ~ 400 Msolar. A derived upper limit for its age is t < 5 10^8 years. Both clusters have mass functions with slopes similar to that of R136, a massive LMC cluster, for which HST results indicate Gamma ~ -1.2. They also seem to be relaxed in their cores and well contained in their tidal radii.	0	0	0

We define an asymmetry of the azimuthal-angle distribution, which, along with the left-right forward-backward polar-angle asymmetry, is sensitive to parity-violating effects in three-jet events; these have yet to be explored experimentally. We have evaluated these observables at O(alpha_s) in perturbative QCD and present their dependence on longitudinal beam polarisation and c.m. energy. We also define a moments analysis in terms of the orientation angles that allows a new and more detailed test of QCD by isolating the six independent helicity cross-sections.	0	5	2

physics/9712053	Importance of an Astrophysical Perspective for Textbook Relativity	The importance of a teaching a clear definition of the ``observer'' in special relativity is highlighted using a simple astrophysical example from the exciting current research area of ``Gamma-Ray Burst'' astrophysics. The example shows that a source moving relativistically toward a single observer at rest exhibits a time ``contraction'' rather than a ``dilation'' because the light travel time between the source and observer decreases with time. Astrophysical applications of special relativity complement idealized examples with real applications and very effectively exemplify the role of a finite light travel time.	0	0	0

astro-ph/9801108	The D/H ratio at z=0.7 toward Q 1718+4807	The apparent discrepancy between low and high D abundances derived from QSO spectra may be caused by spatial correlations in the stochastic velocity field. If one accounts for such correlations, one finds good agreement between different observations and the theoretical predictions for standard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN). In particular, we show that the H+D Ly-alpha profile observed at z = 0.7 toward Q1718+4807 is compatible with 4.1*10^{-5} <= D/H <= 4.7*10^{-5}. This result is consistent with our previous D/H determination for the z = 2.504 system toward Q1009+2956 and, thus, supports SBBN.	0	5	4
astro-ph/9801321	The Luminosity Function and Mass Function in the Galactic Bulge	We present deep photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in a field in Baade's Window in the Galactic bulge. We derive a luminosity function down to I ~ 24.3, or V ~ 27.5, corresponding to M ~ 0.3 Msun. The luminosity function from the turnoff down to this level appears remarkably similar to that observed in the solar neighborhood. We derive a mass function using both an empirical local mass-luminosity relation and a mass-luminosity relation from recent stellar model calculations, allowing for the presence of binaries and photometric errors. The mass function has a power law form with dN/dM proportional to M^{-2.2} for M >~ 0.7 Msun. However, we find strong evidence for a break in the mass function slope around 0.5-0.7 Msun, with a significantly shallower slope at lower masses. The value of the slope for the low masses depends on the assumed binary fraction and the accuracy of our completeness correction. This mass function should directly reflect the initial mass function.	0	2	2
cond-mat/9801127	Scaling Range and Cutoffs in Empirical Fractals	Fractal structures appear in a vast range of physical systems. A literature survey including all experimental papers on fractals which appeared in the six Physical Review journals (A-E and Letters) during the 1990's shows that experimental reports of fractal behavior are typically based on a scaling range $\Delta$ which spans only 0.5 - 2 decades. This range is limited by upper and lower cutoffs either because further data is not accessible or due to crossover bends. Focusing on spatial fractals, a classification is proposed into (a) aggregation; (b) porous media; (c) surfaces and fronts; (d) fracture and (e) critical phenomena. Most of these systems, [except for class (e)] involve processes far from thermal equilibrium. The fact that for self similar fractals [in contrast to the self affine fractals of class (c)] there are hardly any exceptions to the finding of $\Delta \le 2$ decades, raises the possibility that the cutoffs are due to intrinsic properties of the measured systems rather than the specific experimental conditions and apparatus. To examine the origin of the limited range we focus on a class of aggregation systems. In these systems a molecular beam is deposited on a surface, giving rise to nucleation and growth of diffusion-limited-aggregation-like clusters. Scaling arguments are used to show that the required duration of the deposition experiment increases exponentially with $\Delta$. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for surfaces such as Al(111) it is shown that these considerations limit the range of fractal behavior to less than two decades in agreement with the experimental findings. It is conjectured that related kinetic mechanisms that limit the scaling range are common in other nonequilibrium processes which generate spatial fractals.	1	14	9

Until now, it was believed that the lowest-degree one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable polynomial potential is sextic. This belief is based on the assumption that the Hamiltonian must be Hermitian. However, it has recently been discovered that there are huge classes of non-Hermitian, ${\cal PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians whose spectra are real, discrete, and bounded below [physics/9712001]. Replacing Hermiticity by the weaker condition of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry allows for new kinds of quasi-exactly solvable theories. The spectra of this family of quartic potentials discussed here are also real, discrete, and bounded below, and the quasi-exact portion of the spectra consists of the lowest $J$ eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the roots of a $J$th-degree polynomial.	0	135	25

astro-ph/9802186	The Stellar Populations of Pixels and Frames	Derived from first physical principles, a few simple rules are presented that can help in both the planning and interpretation of CCD and IR-array camera observations of resolvable stellar populations. These rules concern the overall size of the population sampled by a frame as measured by its total luminosity, and allow to estimate the number of stars (in all evolutionary stages) that are included in the frame. The total luminosity sampled by each pixel (or resolution element) allows instead to estimate to which depth meaningful stellar photometry can be safely attempted, and below which crowding makes it impossible. Simple relations give also the number of pixels (resolution elements) in the frame that will contain an unresolved blend of two stars of any kind. It is shown that the number of such blends increases quadratically with both the surface brightness of the target, as well as with the angular size of the pixel (or resolution element). A series of examples are presented illustrating how the rules are practically used in concrete observational situations. Application of these tools to existing photometric data for the inner parts of the bulge of M31, M32 and NGC 147 indicates that no solid evidence has yet emerged for the presence of a significant intermediate age population in these objects.	0	64	64

In particular, we focus on the Sunyaev--Zel'dovich effect in submm and mm bands, and estimate the reliability of the estimates of the global Hubble constant $H_0$ and the peculiar velocity of clusters $v_r$. Our simulations indicate that fractional uncertainties of the estimates of $H_0$ amount to $\sim 20%$ mainly due to the departure from the isothermal and spherical gas density distribution. We find a systematic underestimate bias of $H_0$ by $\sim 20%$ for clusters $z\approx 1$, but not at $z\approx 0$. The gas temperature drop in the central regions of our simulated clusters leads to the underestimate bias of $v_r$ by $\sim 5%$ at $z\approx 0$ and by $\sim 15%$ at $z\approx 1$ in addition to the statistical errors of the comparable amount due to the non-spherical gas profile.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9802284	Evolution of mass segregation in open clusters: some observational evidences	On the basis of the best available member list and duplicity information, we have studied the radial structure of Praesepe and of the very young open cluster NGC 6231. We have found mass segregation among the cluster members and between binaries and single stars, which is explained by the greater average mass of the multiple systems. However, the degree of mass segregation for stars between 1.5 and 2.3 M_sun is less pronounced in Praesepe than in the Pleiades. Furthermore, mass segregation is already present in the very young open cluster NGC 6231 although this cluster is likely still not dynamically relaxed. We discuss the implications of these results and propose a qualitative scenario for the evolution of mass segregation in open clusters. In Praesepe the mass function of single stars and primaries appears to be significantly different, like in the Pleiades. We observe an absence of ellipticity of the outer part of Praesepe.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9802327	Hubble Deep Fever: A faint galaxy diagnosis	The longstanding faint blue galaxy problem is gradually subsiding as a result of technological advancement, most notably from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging. In particular two categorical facts have recently been established, these are: 1) The excess faint blue galaxies are of irregular morphologies, and, 2) the majority of these irregulars occur at redshifts 1 < z < 2. These conclusions are based on the powerful combination of morphological and photometric redshift data for all galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field to I < 26. Our interpretation is that the faint blue galaxy excess, which incidentally coincides with the peak in the observed mean galaxy star formation rate, represents the final formation epoch of the familiar spiral galaxy population. This conclusion is corroborated by the low abundance of normal spirals at z > 2. Taking these facts together we favour a scenario where the faint blue excess is primarily due to the formation epoch of spiral systems via merging at redshifts 1 < z < 2. The final interpretation now awaits refinements in our understanding of the local galaxy population !	0	0	0
chao-dyn/9802023	Universality for the breakup of invariant tori in Hamiltonian flows	In this article, we describe a new renormalization-group scheme for analyzing the breakup of invariant tori for Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom. The transformation, which acts on Hamiltonians that are quadratic in the action variables, combines a rescaling of phase space and a partial elimination of irrelevant (non-resonant) frequencies. It is implemented numerically for the case applying to golden invariant tori. We find a nontrivial fixed point and compute the corresponding scaling and critical indices. If one compares flows to maps in the canonical way, our results are consistent with existing data on the breakup of golden invariant circles for area-preserving maps.	0	12	5

We first develop a simple analytical method to obtain equilibrium configurations and energies for few particles. When the confinement is harmonic, we prove that the first transition from a single shell occurs when the number of particles changes from five to six. The shell structure in the case of an arbitrary number of particles is shown to be independent of the strength of the interaction but dependent only on its functional form. It is also independent of the magnetic field strength when included. We further study the effect of the functional form of the confinement potential on the shell structure. Finally we report some interesting results when a three-body interaction is included, albeit in a particular model.	1	5	2

The colloidal suspension, that is in a crystalline phase, is considered using a spherical Wigner-Seitz cell. After the Donnan equilibrium is achieved, there will be a difference in pressure between the two sides of the membrane. Using the functional density theory, we obtained the expression for the osmotic pressure as a function of the concentration of added salt, the colloidal volume fraction, and the size and charge of the colloidal particles. The results are compared with the experimental measurements for ordered polystyrene lattices of two different particle sizes over a range of ionic strengths and colloidal volume fractions.	1	1	1

We find our results for spin-independent splittings in physical units to be independent of the lattice spacing, indicating the absence of systematic errors from discretisation effects.

We find that transverse gauge invariant non-equilibrium expectation values of fields relax via {\em power laws} to asymptotic amplitudes that are determined by the quasiparticle poles. The long time relaxational dynamics and relevant time scales are determined by the behaviour of the retarded self-energy not at the small frequencies, but at the Landau damping thresholds. This explains the presence of power laws and not of exponential decay. Furthermore, we derive the influence functional, the Langevin equation and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for the soft modes, identifying the correlation functions that emerge in the classical limit. We show that a Markovian approximation fails to describe the dynamics {\em both} at short and long times. We also introduce a novel kinetic approach that goes beyond the standard Boltzmann equation and incorporates off-shell processes and find that the distribution function for soft quasiparticles relaxes with a power law through Landau damping. We also find an unusual dressing dynamics of bare particles and anomalous (logarithmic) relaxation of hard quasiparticles.	0	37	33
hep-ph/9802401	Failure of JoAnne's Global Fit to the Wilson Coefficients in Rare B Decays: A Left-Right Model Example	In the Standard Model and many of its extensions, it is well known that all of the observables associated with the rare decays $b\to s\gamma$ and $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ can be expressed in terms of the three Wilson coefficients, $C_{7L,9L,10L}(\mu \sim m_b)$, together with several universal kinematic functions. In particular it has been shown that the numerical values of these coefficients can be uniquely extracted by a three parameter global fit to data obtainable at future $B$-factories given sufficient integrated luminosity. In this paper we examine if such global fits are also sensitive to new operators beyond those which correspond to the above coefficients, i.e., whether is it possible that new operators can be of sufficient importance for the three parameter fit to fail and for this to be experimentally observable. Using the Left-Right Symmetric Model as an example of a scenario with an extended operator basis, we demonstrate via Monte Carlo techniques that such a possibility can indeed be realized. In some sense this potential failure of the global fit approach can actually be one of its greatest successes in identifying the existence of new physics.	0	21	21
hep-ph/9802415	Inflation	The shortcomings of the Standard Big Bang Cosmological Model as well as their resolution in the context of inflationary cosmology are discussed. The inflationary scenario and the subsequent oscillation and decay of the inflaton field are then studied in some detail. The density perturbations produced during inflation and their evolution during the matter dominated era are presented. The temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation are summarized. The non-supersymmetric as well as the supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model is introduced and the `reheating' of the universe is analyzed in the context of the latter and a left-right symmetric gauge group. The scenario of baryogenesis via a primordial leptogenesis is considered in some detail. It is, finally, pointed out that, in the context of a supersymmetric model based on a left-right symmetric gauge group, hybrid inflation, baryogenesis via primordial leptogenesis and neutrino oscillations are linked. This scheme, supplemented by a familiar ansatz for the neutrino Dirac masses and mixing of the two heaviest families and with the MSW resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle, implies that the tau-neutrino mass lies approximately between 1 and 9 eV. The mu-tau mixing angle is predicted to lie in a narrow range which will be partially tested by the Chorus/Nomad experiment.	0	13	12
hep-th/9802016	Topological Gravity as Large N Topological Gauge Theory	We consider topological closed string theories on Calabi-Yau manifolds which compute superpotential terms in the corresponding compactified type II effective action. In particular, near certain singularities we compare the partition function of this topological theory (the Kodaira-Spencer theory) to $SU(\infty)$ Chern-Simons theory on the vanishing 3-cycle. We find agreement between these theories, which we check explicitly for the case of shrinking $S^3$ and Lens spaces, at the perturbative level. Moreover, the gauge theory has non-perturbative contributions which have a natural interpretation in the Type IIB picture. We provide a heuristic explanation for this agreement as well as suggest further equivalences in other topological gravity/gauge systems.	0	62	54

We find that the experimental $\Lambda p$ elastic scattering data as well as the predictions from the J\"ulich-Bonn model are in reasonable agreement with the new results on $K^+$-meson production. We propose to study directly the final state interaction by measurements of the cross section as a function of the hyperon momentum in the $\Lambda p$ cm system.	0	9	7
astro-ph/9803142	On the fractal structure of galaxy distribution and its implications for cosmology	Two fundamental empirical laws have been established in the analysis of galaxy space distribution. First, recent analyses have revealed that the three dimensional distribution of galaxies and clusters is characterized by large scale structures and huge voids: such a distribution shows fractal correlations up to the limits of the available samples. This has confirmed the earlier de Vaucouleurs power-law density - distance relation, now corresponding to a fractal structure with dimension $D \approx 2$, at least, in the range of scales $ \sim 1 \div 200 Mpc$ ($H_0 = 55 km/sec/Mpc$). An eventual cut-off towards homogenization has not been yet identified. Second, since Hubble's discovery, the linear redshift-distance law has been well established within $200 Mpc$ and also much deeper. The co-existence of these laws within the same scales is a challenge for the standard cosmology where the linear Hubble law is a strict consequence of homogeneity of the expanding universe. This puzzle is now sufficiently strong to raise doubts for the standard cosmology.	0	5	2
astro-ph/9803203	Projected rotational velocities of WD1614+136 and WD1353+409 - implications for the rate of galactic Type Ia supernovae	The white dwarf stars WD1614+136 and WD1353+409 are not sufficiently massive to have formed through single star evolution. However, observations to date have not yet found any evidence for binarity. It has therefore been suggested that these stars are the result of a merger. In this paper we place an upper limit of approximately 50kms on the projected rotational velocities of both stars. This suggests that, if these stars are the results of a merger, efficient angular momentum loss with accompanying mass loss must have occurred. If the same process occurs following the merging of more massive white dwarf stars, the predicted rate of Type Ia supernovae due to merging white dwarfs may have been greatly over-estimated. Further observations to determine binarity in WD1614+136 and WD1353+409 are therefore encouraged.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9803204	On the evolutionary behaviour of BL Lac objects	We present a new well defined sample of BL Lac objects selected from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). The sample consists of 39 objects with 35 forming a flux limited sample down to f_X = 8 x 10^{-13} cgs, redshifts are known for 33 objects (and 31 of the complete sample). X-ray spectral properties were determined for each object individually with the RASS data. The luminosity function of RASS selected BL Lac objects is compatible with results provided by objects selected with the Einstein observatory, but the RASS selected sample contains objects with luminosities at least tenfold higher. Our analysis confirms the negative evolution for X-ray selected BL Lac objects found in a sample by the Einstein observatory, the parameterization provides similar results. A subdivision of the sample into halves according to the X-ray to optical flux ratio yielded unexpected results. The extremely X-ray dominated objects have higher redshifts and X-ray luminosities and only this subgroup shows clear signs of strong negative evolution. The evolutionary behaviour of objects with an intermediate spectral energy distribution between X-ray and radio dominated is compatible with no evolution at all. Consequences for unified schemes of X-ray and radio selected BL Lac objects are discussed.We suggest that the intermediate BL Lac objects are the basic BL Lac population. The distinction between the two subgroups can be explained if extreme X-ray dominated BL Lac objects are observed in a state of enhanced X-ray activity.	0	1	1

It is predicted that the mean helical repeat length (HRL) for short DNA rings increases with the decreasing of chain length; while for very long chains, their mean HRL is the same, independent of both the chain length and whether the ends are closed, it is longer than the value for rectilinear DNAs.

We explicitly determine thermodynamic distribution functions and establish a duality which generalizes the duality for fractional exclusion statistics in the sense of Haldane.	1	9	3
cond-mat/9803273	Magnetic field -induced phase transition in a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductor at low temperatures	We consider, within BCS weak coupling theory, the instability of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconductor to a state of mixed symmetry $d+iq$, $q=d_{xy},s$. In zero magnetic field we show that there is a large and physically reasonable range of interaction strengths for which a pure $d_{x^2-y^2}$ state is stable down to T=0. In this case a magnetic field, assumed to couple to quasiparticles via their Doppler shifts in the vortex superflow field, is shown to induce a phase transition at $T=T_c^*\sim \sqrt{H}$. Below $T_c^*$, the density of states remains gapless but its field dependence is substantially supressed. The theory explains many features of recent striking thermal conductivity measurements on BSCCO by Krishana et al.	1	0	0

We add terms from constraint equations to the evolution equations with appropriate combinations, which is the same technique used by Iriondo, Leguizam\'on and Reula [Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 4732 (1997)]. However our system is different from theirs in the points that we primarily use Hermiticity of a characteristic matrix of the system to characterize our system "symmetric", discuss the consistency of this system with reality condition, and show the characteristic speeds of the system.	0	21	21

We also give the corresponding tree-level amplitudes with an additional gluon radiated off the quark line.

We perform our NLO analysis strictly in x space, avoiding difficulties in moment inversion. Small-x results and other physical considerations are discussed.	0	36	36
hep-ph/9803359	Modification of parton distributions in nuclei	Nuclear parton distributions are studied in a parton model with rescaling and recombination mechanisms. Parton x distributions are first calculated at Q^2=1 GeV^2 by the model, and they are evolved to larger Q^2 in order to be compared with various F_2 data. The experimental shadowing is explained by the parton-recombination effects. Then, the modification of sea-quark and gluon distributions is investigated. We show x and Q^2 dependent results of the ratios S_A/S_D and G_A/G_D. They indicate significant shadowing at small x and large ratios in the medium-x region. Our theoretical results should be tested by future experiments, for example, at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider). Furthermore, our studies are important for finding a signature of the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion reactions. We also indicate that nuclear effects in the deuteron should be taken into account for finding the accurate F_2 structure function of the neutron.	0	9	8
hep-ph/9803412	Magnetohydrodynamics of the Early Universe and the Evolution of Primordial Magnetic Fields	We show that the decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence leads to a more rapid growth of the correlation length of a primordial magnetic field than that caused by the expansion of the Universe. As an example, we consider the magnetic fields created during the electroweak phase transition. The expansion of the universe alone would yield a correlation length at the present epoch of 1 AU, whereas we find that the correlation length is likely of order 100 AU, and cannot possibly be longer than $10^4$ AU for non-helical fields. If the primordial field is strongly helical, the correlation length can be much larger, but we show that even in this case it cannot exceed 100 pc. All these estimates make it hard to believe that the observed galactic magnetic fields can result from the amplification of seed fields generated at the electroweak phase transition by the standard galactic dynamo.	0	97	17
hep-ph/9803413	Isospin Symmetry Breaking in the Quark Condensates, $< \bar dd>\not= < \bar uu>$, as Estimated from QCD Sum Rules	Isospin symmetry breaking in the quark condensates, $< \bar dd> \not= < \bar uu>$, is a fundamental parameter in both the QCD sum rule studies and the chiral perturbation theory. In this article, we apply the QCD sum rule method to treat the hyperon mass difference ${1\over 2}(m_{\Sigma^-}+m_{\Sigma^0})-m_{\Sigma^+}$ in order to obtain a reasonable estimate on such isospin symmetry breaking parameter $\gamma$ defined as $(< \bar dd>-< \bar uu>)/ < \bar uu>$. Note that the electromagnetic contributions to the particular mass difference are expected to cancel almost completely. Using the light-quark mass difference $m_d-m_u=4\pm 1$ MeV and the experimental data ${1\over 2}(m_{\Sigma^-}+m_{\Sigma^0})-m_{\Sigma^+}$$=5.62\pm 0.13$ MeV, we obtain $\gamma= -0.011\pm 0.001$, a value which is slightly larger than the commonly adopted value and is of smaller uncertainty.	0	0	0

Monopoles on D3 branes give the natural understanding by embedding in SU(N) through the constraints on both the asymptotic Higgs field (corresponding to the horizontal positions of D3 branes) and the magnetic charges (corresponding to the number of D1 branes) imposed by the O3 plane. The compatibility conditions of Nahm data for monopoles for these groups can be interpreted very naturally through the D1 branes in the presence of O3 plane.	0	4	4
hep-th/9803202	Background Harmonic Superfields in N=2 Supergravity	A modification of the harmonic superfield formalism in $D=4, N=2$ supergravity using a subsidiary condition of covariance under the background supersymmetry with a central charge ($B$-covariance) is considered. Conservation of analyticity together with the $B$-covariance leads to the appearance of linear gravitational superfields. Analytic prepotentials arise in a decomposition of the background linear superfields in terms of spinor coordinates and transform in a nonstandard way under the background supersymmetry. The linear gravitational superfields can be written via spinor derivatives of nonanalytic spinor prepotentials. The perturbative expansion of the extended supergravity action in terms of the $B$-covariant superfields and the corresponding version of the differential-geometric formalism are considered. We discuss the dual harmonic representation of the linearized extended supergravity, which corresponds to the dynamical condition of Grassmann analyticity.	0	2	2
math/9803125	Inverse tridiagonal Z-matrices	In this paper, we consider matrices whose inverses are tridiagonal Z--matrices. Based on a characterization of symmetric tridiagonal matrices by Gantmacher and Krein, we show that a matrix is the inverse of a tridiagonal Z--matrix if and only if, up to a positive scaling of the rows, it is the Hadamard product of a so called weak type $\D$ matrix and a flipped weak type $\D$ matrix whose parameters satisfy certain quadratic conditions. We predict from these parameters to which class of Z--matrices the inverse belongs to. In particular, we give a characterization of inverse tridiagonal M--matrices. Moreover, we characterize inverses of tridiagonal M--matrices that satisfy certain row sum criteria. This leads to the cyclopses that are matrices constructed from type $\D$ and flipped type $\D$ matrices. We establish some properties of the cyclopses and provide explicit formulae for the entries of the inverse of a nonsingular cyclops. We also show that the cyclopses are the only generalized ultrametric matrices whose inverses are tridiagonal.	0	0	0
math/9803157	The structure of a solvmanifold's Heegaard splittings	We classify isotopy classes of irreducible Heegaard splittings of solvmanifolds. If the monodromy of the solvmanifold can be expressed as a 2 x 2 matrix with 0 in the lower right hand corner (as always is true when the absolute value of the trace is 3), then any irreducible splitting is strongly irreducible and of genus two. If furthermore the absolute value of the trace is 4 or greater, then any two such splittings are isotopic. If the absolute value of the trace is 3 then, up to isotopy, there are exactly two irreducible splittings, their associated hyperelliptic involutions commute, and the product of the involutions is the central involution of the solvmanifold. If the monodromy cannot be expressed as a 2 x 2 matrix with 0 in the lower right hand corner, then the splitting is weakly reducible, of genus three and unique up to isotopy.	0	1	1
quant-ph/9803055	A topos perspective on the Kochen-Specker theorem: I. Quantum States as Generalized Valuations	The Kochen-Specker theorem asserts the impossibility of assigning values to quantum quantities in a way that preserves functional relations between them. We construct a new type of valuation which is defined on all operators, and which respects an appropriate version of the functional composition principle. The truth-values assigned to propositions are (i) contextual; and (ii) multi-valued, where the space of contexts and the multi-valued logic for each context come naturally from the topos theory of presheaves. The first step in our theory is to demonstrate that the Kochen-Specker theorem is equivalent to the statement that a certain presheaf defined on the category of self-adjoint operators has no global elements. We then show how the use of ideas drawn from the theory of presheaves leads to the definition of a generalized valuation in quantum theory whose values are sieves of operators. In particular, we show how each quantum state leads to such a generalized valuation.	0	29	16

The errors caused by uneven spatial sampling of typical multi--frequency VLBA datasets are estimated through numerical simulations, and are shown to be of the order of 10%, for pixels with the deconvolution SNR~7. The fitted spectral parameters are corrected for the errors due to limited frequency coverage of VLBI data.

cond-mat/9804026	Superconducting Condensate Formation in Quasi-2D Systems with Arbitrary Carrier Density	A phase diagram for a quasi-2D metal with variable carrier density has been derived. The phases present are the normal phase, where the order parameter is zero; the pseudogap phase where the absolute value of the order parameter is non-zero but its phase is random, and a superconducting phase with a crossover quasi-2D Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) region. The crossover region is bounded by the quasi-2D BKT temperature and the temperature for the onset of conventional long-range order (CLRO). The practical observation of these regions however critically depends on the carrier density. At high densities both the pseudogap and BKT regions vanish asymptotically i.e. one obtains the standard BCS picture. At intermediate densities the pseudogap phase is large but the BKT region negligible. Finally at very low densities both the pseudogap and BKT regions are sizeable. An attempt is made to explain the behaviour observed in underdoped (intermediate densities) and optimally doped high-$T_{c}$ superconducting compounds above their critical temperature. The transition to the pseudogap phase should also be regarded as a crossover.	1	8	6

This way of calculating Sigma(z) turns out to be considerably more reliable and accurate than via the impurity Green's function alone. We show results for the self-energy for the case of a constant coupling between impurity and conduction band (ImDelta = const) and the effective Delta(z) arising in the Dynamical Mean Field Theory of the Hubbard model. Implications to the problem of the metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard model are also discussed.	1	163	141
cond-mat/9804243	Cooperativity in Protein Folding: From Lattice Models with Side Chains to Real Proteins	We consider equilibrium folding transitions in lattice protein models with and without side chains. A dimensionless measure, $Omega_{c}$, is introduced to quantitatively assess the degree of cooperativity in lattice models and in real proteins. We show that larger values of $\Omega_{c}$ resembling those seen in proteins are obtained in lattice models with side chains (LMSC). The enhanced cooperativity in LMSC is due to the possibility of denser packing of side chains in the interior of the model protein. We also establish that $\Omega_{c}$ correlates extremely well with (\sigma = (T_{\theta} -T_{f} )/T_{\theta}), where (T_{\theta}) and (T_{f}) are collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. These theoretical ideas are used to analyze folding transitions in various real proteins. The values of $\Omega _{c}$ extracted from experiments show a correlation with $\sigma $. We conclude that the degree of cooperativity can be expressed in terms of the single parameter $\sigma $, which can be estimated from experimental data.	1	0	0

We demonstrate that while the former correction is usually negligible by comparison with statistical fluctuations, the latter may not be, and give criteria for judging the range of validity of histogram extrapolations based on the size of this latter correction.	1	12	6

We obtain satisfactory result for the pseudoscalar mesons. For the scalar mesons, the 't Hooft interaction somewhat increases the values of the masses. However, it is not sufficient to explain the whole scalar mass spectrum. The situation could be improved for the $\sigma$ and $f_0$ mesons through mixing with the glueball state. For the description of the masses of $a_0$ and $\kstar$ mesons, it is necessary to involve the other models. The strong decay widths of the scalar mesons are described.	0	24	24

math-ph/9804004	Projective Group Algebras	In this paper we apply a recently proposed algebraic theory of integration to projective group algebras. These structures have received some attention in connection with the compactification of the $M$ theory on noncommutative tori. This turns out to be an interesting field of applications, since the space $\hat G$ of the equivalence classes of the vector unitary irreducible representations of the group under examination becomes, in the projective case, a prototype of noncommuting spaces. For vector representations the algebraic integration is equivalent to integrate over $\hat G$. However, its very definition is related only at the structural properties of the group algebra, therefore it is well defined also in the projective case, where the space $\hat G$ has no classical meaning. This allows a generalization of the usual group harmonic analysis. A particular attention is given to abelian groups, which are the relevant ones in the compactification problem, since it is possible, from the previous results, to establish a simple generalization of the ordinary calculus to the associated noncommutative spaces.	0	2	0

physics/9804004	Cooperative dynamics in auditory brain response	Simultaneous estimates of the activity in the left and right auditory cortex of five normal human subjects were extracted from Multichannel Magnetoencephalography recordings. Left, right and binaural stimulation were used, in separate runs, for each subject. The resulting time-series of left and right auditory cortex activity were analysed using the concept of mutual information. The analysis constitutes an objective method to address the nature of inter-hemispheric correlations in response to auditory stimulations. The results provide a clear evidence for the occurrence of such correlations mediated by a direct information transport, with clear laterality effects: as a rule, the contralateral hemisphere leads by 10-20ms, as can be seen in the average signal. The strength of the inter-hemispheric coupling, which cannot be extracted from the average data, is found to be highly variable from subject to subject, but remarkably stable for each subject.	0	5	0

astro-ph/9805274	The difference between the narrow line region of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies	This paper presents a comparative study of emission line ratios of the Narrow Line Region (NLR) of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. It includes a literature compilation of the emission line fluxes [OII]3727A, [NeIII]3869A, [OIII]5007A and [NeV]3426A, as well as 60mum continuum flux, for a sample of 52 Seyfert 1's and 68 Seyfert 2's. The distribution of the emission line ratios [OII]/[NeIII] and [OII]/[NeV] shows that Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's are statistically different, in the sense that Seyfert 1's have values smaller than those of Seyfert 2's, indicating a higher excitation spectrum. These and other emission line ratios are compared with sequences of models which combine different proportions of matter and ionization bounded clouds and also sequences of models which vary only the ionization parameter. This comparison shows that the former models reproduce better the overall distribution of emission line ratios, indicating that Seyfert 1's have a smaller number of ionization bounded clouds than Seyfert 2's. This difference, together with other results available in the literature, are interpreted from the point of view of four different scenarios. The most likely scenario assumes that Seyfert 1's have NLR's smaller than those of Seyfert 2's, possibly due to a preferential alignment of the torus axis close to the host galaxy plane axis in Seyfert 1's.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9805285	Morphology of Clusters and Superclusters in N-body simulations of Cosmological Gravitational Clustering	We analyse shapes of overdense regions (clusters and superclusters) in controlled N-body simulations of gravitational clustering with power law initial spectra P(k) \propto k^n, n = -3, -2, -1, 0. At values of the density just above the percolation transition the number of distinct (isolated) clusters peaks and we use this `natural threshold' to study the shapes and multiplicity function of clusters and superclusters. We find that the extent of both filamentarity and pancakeness increases as the simulation evolves, the former being appreciably larger than the latter at virtually all epochs and for all spectra considered by us. Our results also show that high density regions within very massive clusters/superclusters are likely to be noticeably filamentary or pancake/ribbon-like when compared to the less dense regions within these objects. We make a detailed study of two, moment-based `shape statistics' proposed, respectively, by Babul & Starkman (BS) and Luo & Vishniac (LV) and find that both LV and BS have certain built-in limitations: LV is biased towards oblate structures and tends to overemphasise this property; neither BS nor LV correctly describe the shape of strongly curved or topologically nontrivial objects. For instance, a thin filamentary torus and a ribbon are both described by BS and LV as being pancakes ! By contrast Shapefinders, a new shape diagnostic not constructed from density moments but from Minskowski functionals, does not suffer from these limitations and appears to faithfully reproduce the shapes of both simple and topologically complex objects.	0	26	26
astro-ph/9805365	The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale XII. The Discovery of Cepheids and a New Distance to NGC 2541	We report the detection of Cepheids and a new distance to the spiral galaxy NGC 2541, based on data obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). A total of 25 exposures (divided into 13 epochs) are obtained using the F555W filter (transformed to Johnson V), and nine exposures (divided into five epochs) using the F814W filter (transformed to Cousins I). Photometric reduction of the data is performed using two independent packages, DoPHOT and DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME, which give very good agreement in the measured magnitudes. A total of 34 bona fide Cepheids, with periods ranging from 12 to over 60 days, are identified based on both sets of photometry. By fitting V and I period-luminosity relations, apparent distance moduli are derived assuming a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and mean color excess of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E(B-V) = 0.10 mag respectively. Adopting A(V)/E(V-I)=2.45, we obtain a true distance modulus to NGC 2541 of 30.47 +/- 0.11 (random) +/- 0.12 (systematic) mag (D = 12.4 +/- 0.6 (random) +/- 0.7 (systematic) Mpc), and a total (Galactic plus internal) mean color excess E(B-V) = 0.08 +/- 0.05 (internal error) mag.	0	2	2
cond-mat/9805011	Electronic origin of magnetic and orbital ordering in insulating LaMnO_3	We derive a spin-orbital model for insulating LaMnO_3 which fulfills the SU(2) symmetry of S=2 spins at Mn^{3+} ions. It includes the complete e_g and t_{2g} superexchange which follows from a realistic Mn^{2+} multiplet structure in cubic site symmetry, and the Jahn-Teller induced orbital interactions. We show that the magnetic ordering observed in LaMnO_3 is stabilized by a purely electronic mechanism due to the e_g-superexchange alone, and provide for the first time a quantitative explanation of the observed transition temperature and the anisotropic exchange interactions.	1	6	6

For temperatures T much less than the barrier height \Delta U, the level quantization near the top of the barrier and the strong frequency dependence of the one-boson transition probability can lead to the regularly spaced deep minima of the thermoactivation rate as a function of the magnetic field applied along the z axis.	1	5	4
cond-mat/9805226	Range dependence of interlayer exchange coupling	We have considered the effects of non magnetic impurities and interface roughness on the interlayer coupling between magnetic layers in metallic multilayers. The two types of defects alter the interlayer coupling in quite different ways. Elastic electron scattering by impurities in the non magnetic spacer layers between magnetic layers produces an exponential decay of the coupling with a characteristic decay length that is considerably longer than the ``global'' transport mean free path for the spacer layer with its surrounding interfaces. Interfacial roughness leads to an attenuation of the coupling that is related to the width of the roughness in relation to the Fermi wavelength; roughness does not alter the range dependence of the coupling. For certain types of electrical transport, e.g., for current perpendicular to the plane of the layers, the scattering from interface roughness and impurities in the spacer layers contribute on an equal footing to the exponential decay of the electron propagators, i.e., global mean free path. We show that interface roughness and impurities in the spacer layer affect the interlayer coupling differently.	1	4	1
gr-qc/9805035	A dynamical symmetry breaking model in Weyl space	The dynamical process following the breaking of Weyl geometry to Riemannian geometry is considered by studying the motion of de Sitter bubbles in a Weyl vacuum. The bubbles are given in terms of an exact, spherically symmetric thin shell solution to the Einstein equations in a Weyl-Dirac theory with a time-dependent scalar field of the form beta = f(t)/r. The dynamical solutions obtained lead to a number of possible applications. An important feature of the thin shell model is the manner in which beta provides a connection between the interior and exterior geometries since information about the exterior geometry is contained in the boundary conditions for beta.	0	13	4

Static branes	This is the first of a series of papers devoted to the group-theoretical analysis of the conditions which must be satisfied for a configuration of intersecting M5-branes to be supersymmetric. In this paper we treat the case of static branes. We start by associating (a maximal torus of) a different subgroup of Spin(10) with each of the equivalence classes of supersymmetric configurations of two M5-branes at angles found by Ohta & Townsend. We then consider configurations of more than two intersecting branes. Such a configuration will be supersymmetric if and only if the branes are G-related, where G is a subgroup of Spin(10) contained in the isotropy of a spinor. For each such group we determine (a lower bound for) the fraction of the supersymmetry which is preserved. We give examples of configurations consisting of an arbitrary number of non-coincident intersecting fivebranes with fractions: 1/32, 1/16, 3/32, 1/8, 5/32, 3/16 and 1/4, and we determine the resulting (calibrated) geometry.	0	19	18

hep-th/9805211	T-Duality in Lattice Regularized Sigma Models	It is shown that when the underlying sigma model of bosonic string theory is written in terms of single-valued fields, which live in the covering space of the target space, Abelian T-duality survives lattice regularization of the world-sheet. The projection onto the target-space is implemented through a sum over cohomology, which bears resemblance to summing over topological sectors in Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the case of string theory on a circle is shown to be explicitly self-dual in the lattice regulated model and automatically forbids vortex excitations which would otherwise destroy the duality. For other target spaces a generalized notion of T-duality is observed in which the target space and the cohomology coefficient group are interchanged under duality. Specific examples show that the fundamental group of the target space may not be preserved in the T-dual theory. Generalized models which exhibit T-duality behaviour, with dynamical variables that live on the k-dimensional cells of (p+1)-dimensional world-volumes, are also constructed. These models correspond to gauge theories, and higher-dimensional analogues, in which one sums over various topological sectors of the theory.	0	2	2

astro-ph/9806043	Numerical investigation of the threshold for primordial black hole formation	First results of a numerical investigation of primordial black hole formation in the radiation dominated phase of the Early Universe are presented. The simulations follow the gravitational collapse of three different families of high-amplitude density fluctuations imposed at the time of horizon crossing. The threshold for black hole formation, \delta_{c} \approx 0.7, is found to be nearly identical for all perturbation families if the control parameter, \delta, is chosen as the total excess mass within the initial horizon volume. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the scaling of black hole mass with distance from the formation threshold, known to occur in near-critical gravitational collapse, applies to primordial black hole formation.	0	7	7
astro-ph/9806283	Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Propagation in the Local Supercluster	We present detailed numerical simulations and analytical approximations of the propagation of nucleons above 10**(19) eV in the Local Supercluster, assuming that the ambient magnetic field is turbulent, and its strength 0.01 < B_rms < 1 micro-Gauss. In such strong magnetic fields, protons in the low energy part of the spectrum, 10**(19) eV < E < E_C diffuse, while the higher energy particles, with E > E_C propagate along nearly straight lines. The magnitude of the transition energy E_C depends mainly on the strength of the magnetic field, the coherence length, and the distance to the source; for B_rms=0.1 micro-Gauss, a largest eddy of length 10 Mpc, and a distance to the source of 10 Mpc, E_C=100 EeV. Our numerical treatment substantially improves on previous analytical approximations, as it allows to treat carefully the transition between the two propagation regimes, as well as the effects due to inhomogeneities expected on scales of a few Mpc. We show that a turbulent magnetic field B_rms=0.1 micro-Gauss, close to equipartition, would allow to reproduce exactly the observed spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays, up to the highest energy observed, for a distance to the source below 10 Mpc, for the geometry of the Local Supercluster, i.e. a sheet of thickness 10 Mpc. Diffusion, in this case, allows to reproduce the high flux beyond the Greisen Zatsepin Kuzmin cut-off, with a soft injection spectrum proportional to E**(-2.4). Moreover, the large deflection angles at the highest energies observed, typically 10 degrees for the above values, would explain why no close-by astrophysical counterpart could be associated with these events.	0	70	62
astro-ph/9806299	Gamma-Ray Bursts and Type Ic Supernovae: SN 1998bw	Recently a Type Ic supernova, SN 1998bw, was discovered coincident with a gamma-ray burst, GRB 980425. The supernova had unusual radio, optical, and spectroscopic properties. We explore here models based upon helium stars in the range 9 - 14 Msun and carbon-oxygen stars 6 - 11 Msun which experience unusually energetic explosions (kinetic energy 0.5 - 2.8 x 10**52 erg). Bolometric light curves and multi-band photometry are calculated and compared favorably with observations. Both LTE and non-LTE spectra are also calculated for the model that agrees best with the light curve, a carbon-oxygen core of 6 Msun exploded with a kinetic energy of 2.2 x 10**52 erg. We also examine potential mechanisms for producing the observed gamma-ray burst (GRB) - shock break-out and relativistic shock deceleration in circumstellar material. For spherically symmetric models, both fail to produce a GRB of even the low luminosity inferred for GRB 980425. The high explosion energies required to understand the supernova are in contrast to what is expected for such massive stars and may indicate that a new sort of explosion has been identified, possibly the consequence of a collapsar (Woosley 1993, 1996). Indeed a more likely explanation for what was seen is a highly asymmetric explosion in which the GRB was produced by a relativistic jet, perhaps viewed obliquely, and only a fraction of the total stellar mass was ejected, the remainder accreting into a black hole. The ejected mass (but not the 56Ni mass), explosion energy, and velocities may then be smaller. Other Type Ic supernova - GRB coincidences are suggested.	0	203	200
astro-ph/9806325	The mass and radius of the M dwarf companion to GD 448	We present spectroscopy and photometry of GD 448, a detached white dwarf - M dwarf binary with a period of 2.47h. We find that the NaI 8200A feature is composed of narrow emission lines due to irradiation of the M dwarf by the white dwarf within broad absorption lines that are essentially unaffected by heating. Combined with an improved spectroscopic orbit and gravitational red shift measurement from spectra of the H-alpha line, we are able to derive masses for the white dwarf and M dwarf directly (0.41 +/- 0.01 solar masses and 0.096 +/- 0.004 solar masses, respectively). We use a simple model of the CaII emission lines to establish the radius of the M dwarf assuming the emission from its surface to be proportional to the incident flux per unit area from the white dwarf. The radius derived is 0.125 +/- 0.020 solar radii. The M dwarf appears to be a normal main-sequence star in terms of its mass and radius and is less than half the size of its Roche lobe. The thermal timescale of the M dwarf is much longer than the cooling age of the white dwarf so we conclude that the M dwarf was unaffected by the common-envelope phase. The anomalous width of the H-alpha emission from the M dwarf remains to be explained, but the strengh of the line may be due to X-ray heating of the M dwarf due to accretion onto the white dwarf from the M dwarf wind.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9806349	Extragalactic Foregrounds of the Cosmic Microwave Background: Prospects for the MAP Mission	(Abridged) While the major contribution to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies are the sought-after primordial fluctuations produced at the surface of last scattering, other effects produce secondary fluctuations at lower redshifts. Here, we study the extragalactic foregrounds of the CMB in the context of the upcoming MAP mission. We first survey the major extragalactic foregrounds and show that discrete sources, the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, and gravitational lensing are the most dominant ones for MAP. We then show that MAP will detect (>5 sigma) about 46 discrete sources and 10 SZ clusters directly with 94 GHz fluxes above 2 Jy. The mean SZ fluxes of fainter clusters can be probed by cross-correlating MAP with cluster positions extracted from existing catalogs. For instance, a MAP-XBACs cross-correlation will be sensitive to clusters with S(94GHz)>200mJy, and will thus provide a test of their virialization state and a measurement of their gas fraction. Finally, we consider probing the hot gas on supercluster scales by cross-correlating the CMB with galaxy catalogs. Assuming that galaxies trace the gas, we show that a cross-correlation between MAP and the APM catalog should yield a marginal detection, or at least a four-fold improvement on the COBE upper limits for the rms Compton y-parameter.	0	49	49
cond-mat/9806029	Finite Element Analysis of Strain Effects on Electronic and Transport Properties in Quantum Dots and Wires	Lattice mismatch in layered semiconductor structures with submicron length scales leads to extremely high nonuniform strains. This paper presents a finite element technique for incorporating the effects of the nonuniform strain into an analysis of the electronic properties of SiGe quantum structures. Strain fields are calculated using a standard structural mechanics finite element package and the effects are included as a nonuniform potential directly in the time independent Schrodinger equation; a k-p Hamiltonian is used to model the effects of multiple valence subband coupling. A variational statement of the equation is formulated and solved using the finite element method. This technique is applied to resonant tunneling diode quantum dots and wires; the resulting densities of states confined to the quantum well layers of the devices are compared to experimental current-voltage I(V) curves.	1	0	0

For cooled configurations we observe improvement of the spectral properties when adding the clover term. For the thermalized case (12^4, beta = 2.4) without clover term we find a rather bad separation of physical and doubler branches making a probabilistic interpretation of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem on the lattice questionable for this beta and lattice size. Adding the clover term leads to the creation of additional real eigenvalues which come in pairs of opposite chirality thus further worsening the situation for the index theorem.	0	21	21

This amounts to first calculating an effective interaction in which the free interaction is modified by the presence of the appropriate nuclear medium. The short--range correlations are included within the framework of Brueckner theory yielding the nuclear reaction matrix and the long--range correlations by using the reaction matrix in many--body perturbation theory to obtain an effective interaction. The resulting effective interaction is then employed in calculating the nuclear properties. Particular emphasis is placed on the ability of our calculation to describe systematic trends of the properties of these nuclei. Both successful achievements and problematic features are pointed out.	0	0	0
quant-ph/9806078	Nested quantum search and NP-complete problems	A quantum algorithm is known that solves an unstructured search problem in a number of iterations of order $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the search space, whereas any classical algorithm necessarily scales as $O(d)$. It is shown here that an improved quantum search algorithm can be devised that exploits the structure of a tree search problem by nesting this standard search algorithm. The number of iterations required to find the solution of an average instance of a constraint satisfaction problem scales as $\sqrt{d^\alpha}$, with a constant $\alpha<1$ depending on the nesting depth and the problem considered. When applying a single nesting level to a problem with constraints of size 2 such as the graph coloring problem, this constant $\alpha$ is estimated to be around 0.62 for average instances of maximum difficulty. This corresponds to a square-root speedup over a classical nested search algorithm, of which our presented algorithm is the quantum counterpart.	0	35	34
astro-ph/9807002	Quintessence, Cosmic Coincidence, and the Cosmological Constant	Recent observations suggest that a large fraction of the energy density of the universe has negative pressure. One explanation is vacuum energy density; another is quintessence in the form of a scalar field slowly evolving down a potential. In either case, a key problem is to explain why the energy density nearly coincides with the matter density today. The densities decrease at different rates as the universe expands, so coincidence today appears to require that their ratio be set to a specific, infinitessimal value in the early universe. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a "tracker field", a form of quintessence, and show how it may explain the coincidence, adding new motivation for the quintessence scenario.	0	1490	759
astro-ph/9807030	Radio Emission and Particle Acceleration in SN 1993J	The radio light curves of SN 1993J are found to be well fit by a synchrotron spectrum, suppressed by external free-free absorption and synchrotron self-absorption. A standard r^-2 circumstellar medium is assumed, and found to be adequate. The magnetic field and number density of relativistic electrons behind the shock are determined. The strength of the magnetic field argues strongly for turbulent amplification behind the shock. The ratio of the magnetic and thermal energy density behind the shock is ~0.14. Synchrotron and Coulomb cooling dominate the losses of the electrons. The injected electron spectrum has a power law index -2.1, consistent with diffusive shock acceleration, and the number density scales with the thermal electron energy density. The total energy density of the relativistic electrons is, if extrapolated to gamma ~ 1, ~ 5x10^-4 of the thermal energy density. The free-free absorption required is consistent with previous calculations of the circumstellar temperature of SN 1993J, T_e ~ (2-10)x10^5 K. The relative importance of free-free absorption, Razin suppression, and the synchrotron self-absorption effect for other supernovae are briefly discussed.

astro-ph/9807087	A Model for Non High Energy Gamma Ray Bursts and Sources of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays	As a progenitor of NHE (Non High Energy) GRBs, we propose a (C+O) star and a neutron star (black hole) close binary system. Since the (C+O) star is tidally locked, a new born pulsar should be a milli second pulsar (MSP). Dynamo will generate a superstrong magnetic field(SSM). The beam of the energy from the super strongly magnetized milli second pulsar can punch a hole in the supernova ejecta . Then the beam of gamma rays flows out of the ejecta. If we observe this beam from the lateral direction, it will be NHE-GRB. In this model the pulsar with the spin period about 1sec should exist in SN1998bw so that the searches for this pulsar in all the wave length are urgent. SSM-MSPs can accelerate protons up to Ultra High Energy. If a few percent of the beam energy of SSM-MSP in NHE-GRB event is in the form of UHECRs, the flux of the observed UHECRs can be explained. Then along the direction of each UHECR, a supernova remnant should be found. It is suggested that NHE-GRB is the progenitor of the soft gamma ray repeater which has also the superstrong magnetic field and is in the supernova remnant.	0	1	1

We demonstrate that the dependence of the topological entropy on the size of the gap has a structure of the devil's staircase. By integrating over a fractal measure, we obtain analytical, piece-wise differentiable approximations of this dependence. Applying concepts of the kneading theory we find the position and the values of the entropy for all leading entropy plateaus.

At the theta transition in 2D, radius of gyration, entropic and crossover exponents are well compatible with the universality class of the corresponding transition of homopolymers. Further strong indication of such class comes from direct comparison with the corresponding annealed problem. In 3D classical exponents are recovered. The percentage of charge sequences leading to folding in a unique ground state approaches zero exponentially with the chain length.	1	2	1
gr-qc/9807013	Basis states for gravitons in non-perturbative loop representation space	A relation between the non-perturbative loop representation space and the semi-classical loop representation space is studied. A sector of (approximate) states and a sector of operators in the non-perturbative loop representation space are made related respectively to the physical states and the basic variables of the semi-classical loop representation space through a transformation. This transformation makes a construction of graviton states within the non-perturbative theory possible although the notion of gravitons originally emerged from semi-classical perturbative treatments. This transformation is ``exact'' in the sense that it does not contain an error term, a fact contrast to the previous construction of a similar transformation. This fact allows the interpretation that these graviton states represent free gravitons even after introducing the self-interaction of gravitons into the theory; the presence of an error term of order of possible perturbative self-interaction would spoil this interpretation. The existence of such an ``exact'' relation of the two theories supports the potential ability of the non-perturbative loop representation quantum gravity to address the physics of gravitons, namely quanta for large scale small fluctuations of gravitational field in the flat background spacetime.	0	5	3

The anomaly is observed over 4 decades in path length and at least a factor of 30 in energy. This restricts the potential oscillation solutions to those with large amplitudes and mixing mass differences that are ruled out by other observations. The $\Delta m^{2}$ region in the range $10^{-4} - 10^{-2}$ leads to inconsistencies within the atmospheric neutrino data itself. The observed value of $R$ seems to be incompatible with the $\Delta m^{2}$ implied by recent results	0	9	7

We find that one-loop gauge corrections of any orbifold limit of K3 can always be expressed by their instanton numbers and generic automorphic forms.These functions classify also one-loop gauge thresholds of N=1 (0,2) heterotic compactifications based on toroidal orbifolds T^6/Z_N.

We show that the one-loop effective potential for excitations of the Yang-Mills field agrees with the classical linearized potential for brane waves in the AdS picture in the limit of long wavelengths. This supports the idea that the AdS/CFT correspondance fits into string theory as expected from previous work.	0	37	37

Taking into account single- and multi-pion photoproduction in the s-channel up to the energy 1.5 GeV and resonances in the t-channel with mass below 1.5 GeV, it is found for the proton and neutron that $[\gamma_\pi]_p$ = -39.5 +/- 2.4 and $[\gamma_\pi]_n$ = 52.5 +/- 2.4, respectively, in units of 10^{-4} fm^4.	0	29	10
quant-ph/9807065	On the averaged quantum dynamics by white-noise Hamiltonians with and without dissipation	Exact results are derived on the averaged dynamics of a class of random quantum-dynamical systems in continuous space. Each member of the class is characterized by a Hamiltonian which is the sum of two parts. While one part is deterministic, time-independent and quadratic, the Weyl-Wigner symbol of the other part is a homogeneous Gaussian random field which is delta correlated in time, but smoothly correlated in position and momentum. The averaged dynamics of the resulting white-noise system is shown to be a monotone mixing increasing quantum-dynamical semigroup. Its generator is computed explicitly. Typically, in the course of time the mean energy of such a system grows linearly to infinity. In the second part of the paper an extended model is studied, which, in addition, accounts for dissipation by coupling the white-noise system linearly to a quantum-mechanical harmonic heat bath. It is demonstrated that, under suitable assumptions on the spectral density of the heat bath, the mean energy then saturates for long times.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9808017	Metal Abundances at z < 1.5: Fresh Clues to the Chemical Enrichment History of Damped Lyman alpha Systems	We explore the redshift evolution of the metal content of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) with new observations of four absorbers at z < 1.5 . The main conclusion is that the column density--weighted mean metallicity, [<Zn/H>] = -1.03 +/- 0.23 (on a logarithmic scale), is not significantly higher at z < 1.5 than at earlier epochs, despite the fact that the comoving star formation rate density of the universe was near its maximum value at this redshift. For three of the four DLAs our observations include absorption lines of Si, Mn, Cr, Fe, and Ni, as well as Zn. We argue that the relative abundances of these elements are consistent with a moderate degree of dust depletion which, once accounted for, leaves no room for the enhancement of the alpha-elements over iron seen in metal poor stars in the Milky Way. This is contrary to previous assertions that DLAs have been enriched solely by Type II supernovae, but can be understood if the rate of star formation in the systems studied proceeded more slowly than in the early history of our Galaxy. These results add to a growing body of data all pointing to the conclusion that known DLAs do not trace the galaxy population responsible for the bulk of star formation. Possible reasons are that sight-lines through metal rich gas are systematically underrepresented because the background QSOs are reddened, and that the most actively star forming galaxies are also the most compact, presenting too small a cross-section to have been probed yet with the limited statistics of current samples.	0	224	224
cond-mat/9808140	Evidence for the droplet/scaling picture of spin glasses	We have studied the Parisi overlap distribution for the three dimensional Ising spin glass in the Migdal-Kadanoff approximation. For temperatures T around 0.7Tc and system sizes upto L=32, we found a P(q) as expected for the full Parisi replica symmetry breaking, just as was also observed in recent Monte Carlo simulations on a cubic lattice. However, for lower temperatures our data agree with predictions from the droplet or scaling picture. The failure to see droplet model behaviour in Monte Carlo simulations is due to the fact that all existing simulations have been done at temperatures too close to the transition temperature so that sytem sizes larger than the correlation length have not been achieved.	1	4	4
cond-mat/9808235	Suppression of antiferromagnetic correlations by quenched dipole--type impurities	The effect of quenched random ferromagnetic bonds on the antiferromagnetic correlation length of a two--dimensional Heisneberg model is studied, applying the renormalization group method to the classical non--linear sigma model with quenched random dipole moments. It is found that the antiferromagnetic long range order is destroyed for any non--zero concentration, of the dipolar defects, even at zero temperature. Below a line T ~ concentration, the correlation length is independent of T, and decreases exponentially with concentration. At higher temperatures, itdecays exponentially with an effective stiffness constant which decreases with concentration/T. The results are used to estimate the three--dimensional N\'{e}el temperature, which decays linearly with $x$ at small concentrations, and drops precipitously at a critical concentration. These predictions are compared with experiments on doped copper oxides, and are shown to reproduce successfully some of the prominent features of the data.	1	6	0
cond-mat/9808255	Coadsorption of CO and O on Ru(0001): A structural analysis by density functional theory	Knowledge of the atomic geometry of a surface is a prerequisite for any detailed understanding of the surface's electronic structure and chemical properties. Previous studies have convincingly demonstrated that density functional theory (DFT) yields accurate surface atomic geometries and that reliable predictions concerning stable and metastable phases can be made on the basis of the calculated energetics. In the present work we use DFT to investigate the atomic structure of four ordered coadsorbate phases of carbon monoxide and oxygen on Ru(0001). All of the structures have a (2x2) periodicity with differing concentrations of CO molecules and O atoms. For two of these phases dynamical low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) intensity analyses have been performed and the agreement between our DFT- and the LEED-determined structures is found to be very good. We predict the atomic geometry of the third phase for which no structural determination based on experiments has been made to date. We also predict the stability of a new ordered mixed phase.	1	0	0

Because of this coupling, the energy-momentum tensor for the matter is not conserved and therefore it is not determined by the trace anomaly. We discuss different approximations for the calculation of the energy-momentum tensor and show how to obtain the correct amount of Hawking radiation. We also compute cosmological particle creation and quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential.	0	29	10

hep-ph/9808317	Radiative corrections to $e^+ e^- \to H^+ H^-$: THDM versus MSSM	One loop radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to H^+ H^-$ are considered at future linear collider energies, in the general type II Two Higgs Doublet Model (THDM) and in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model-like (MSSM) Higgs sector. To make the comparison between THDM and MSSM tractable, we have introduced a quasi-SUSY parameterization which preserves all the tree-level Higgs mass-sum-rules of the MSSM, and involves just 3 free parameters in the Higgs sector (instead of 7 in the general THDM) and comprises the MSSM as a particular case. The model-independent soft photon contribution is isolated and shown to be substantial. Important effects come also from the contribution of the model dependent $h^0 H^+ H^-$ and $H^0 H^+ H^-$ vertices to the final state. In the MSSM, the contribution of the Higgs sector is moderate (a few percent) while in the THDM and both for small and large $\tan \beta$ important effects ($\sim +30%$) can be found.	0	35	34
hep-ph/9808321	Units and Numerical Values of the Effective Couplings in Perturbative Heterotic String Vacua	We determine the units and numerical values for a class of couplings in the effective theory of perturbative heterotic string vacua, with the emphasis on the correct translation between the canonical gauge coupling g and Planck scale M_Planck ~ 1.2 x 10^19 GeV as used in the effective theory description and the string coupling g_string and string tension alpha' as used in the S-matrix amplitude calculation. In particular, we determine the effective couplings in the superpotential and revisit the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term in a class of models with an anomalous U(1). We derive the values of the effective Yukawa couplings (at the third and fourth order) after the restabilization of vacuum along a particular F- and D-flat direction and show that they are comparable in magnitude. The result corrects results quoted in the literature, and may have implications for the string derived phenomenology, e.g., that of fermion textures.	0	22	16

After a brief summary of the theoretical basis for a Gaussian-smearing approach, we present a systematic study of recent results on fixed-target and collider direct-photon production, using complementary data on diphoton and pion production to provide empirical guidance on the required amount of kt broadening. This approach provides a consistent description of the observed pattern of deviation of next-to-leading order QCD calculations relative to the direct-photon data, and accounts for the shape and normalization difference between fixed-order perturbative calculations and the data. We also discuss the uncertainties in this phenomenological approach, the implications of these results on the extraction of the gluon distribution of the nucleon, and the comparison of our findings to recent related work.	0	117	86

Several quantities of interest in this process like the decay rate $\lambda$, the period of oscillation $T_{osc}$, the transient time $t_{tr}$, the tunneling time $t_{tun}$ and the average value of the proton packet position $ r_{av} $ are computed and compared with the WKB results.	0	0	0

This generates an additional fluctuating amplitude and a corresponding new term to be added incoherently to the usual cross-section. The appropriate extension of an applicable reaction calculation is considered in order to estimate this effect.	0	1	1
quant-ph/9808014	Dynamical Cooling of Trapped Gases I: One Atom Problem	We study the laser cooling of one atom in an harmonic trap beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. By using sequences of laser pulses of different detunings we show that the atom can be confined into just one state of the trap, either the ground state or an excited state of the harmonic potential. The last can be achieved because under certain conditions an excited state becomes a dark state. We study the problem in one and two dimensions. For the latter case a new cooling mechanism is possible, based on the destructive interference between the effects of laser fields in different directions, which allows the creation of variety of dark states. For both, one and two dimensional cases, Monte Carlo simulations of the cooling dynamics are presented.	0	1	1

We show that there is an underlying SU(1,1) algebra in both of these models which plays a crucial role in such an identification. Further, we show that our analysis is in fact valid for any many-particle system in arbitrary dimensions whose potential term (apart from the oscillator or the Coulomb-like potential) is a homogeneous function of coordinates of degree -2. The explicit coordinate transformation which maps the Coulomb-like problem to the oscillator one has also been determined in some specific cases.	0	4	0

astro-ph/9809037	The giant-amplitude X-ray outburst in NGC 5905 - a tidal disruption event ?	NGC 5905 is one of the very few galaxies that underwent a giant X-ray outburst, with a change in photon countrate of a factor 100. The outburst spectrum is both, very soft and luminous (Bade, Komossa & Dahlem 1996). Remarkably, the optical pre-outburst emission line spectrum of NGC 5905 is that of an HII-type galaxy, i.e. does not show any signs of Seyfert activity. One exciting explanation of the X-ray observation is that we may have witnessed the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) residing in the nucleus of this galaxy. The expected flare of electromagnetic radiation being produced when the stellar debris is swallowed by the black hole was proposed by Rees (1988) as a means of tracing SMBHs in nearby non-active galaxies. In the present work, we discuss this and other possible outburst scenarios through an analysis of all ROSAT PSPC and HRI X-ray observations of NGC 5905. We also present simultaneous and long-term optical photometry of NGC 5905 as well as follow-up optical spectroscopy.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9809044	Studying the Evolution of Field Galaxies Using NICMOS/HST Parallel Imaging and Grism Data	We present results from our analysis of F160W NICMOS Parallel images. These data cover $\sim$~9~sq. arcminutes and reach 3$\sigma$ depths of H$=$ 24.3 $-$ 25.5 in a $0.6''$ diameter aperture with integration times of 2,000 to 13,000 seconds. We derive the first deep H band galaxy counts. The slope of the counts for H$<$ 20 is 0.31, consistent with various K-band measurements from the Keck telescopes. The measured number counts vs. magnitude relation is reasonably well fitted with no-evolution models with a low $\Omega$ value. The half-light radii of the galaxies declines steeply with apparent magnitude and reaches the NIC3 resoltion limit at H$=$23.5. Deep ground-based VRI imaging of one NICMOS field has revealed an extremely red galaxy with R$-$H $=$ 6 and H of 18.8. Our analyses of the grism data show that we can reach 3$\sigma$ flux limits of of $1\times 10^{-16}$ to $2\times10^{-17}$ ergs/sec/cm$^2$ for integration times of 2,000 to 21,000~seconds. We have detected a total of 33 emission line galaxies. The comoving number density is $\rm \sim 2\times 10^{-4} Mpc^{-3}$. The detected emission lines are probably H$_\alpha$~6563\AA. Thus, the derived star formation rates, without extinction correction, are $10 - 163 M\odot$ per year for galaxies at redshifts between 0.7 and 1.9.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9809083	On the Fate of Gas Accreting at a Low Rate onto a Black Hole	Gas supplied conservatively to a black hole at rates well below the Eddington rate may not be able to radiate effectively and the net energy flux, including the energy transported by the viscous torque, is likely to be close to zero at all radii. This has the consequence that the gas accretes with positive energy so that it may escape. Accordingly, we propose that only a small fraction of the gas supplied actually falls onto the black hole and that the binding energy it releases is transported radially outward by the torque so as to drive away the remainder in the form of a wind. This is a generalization of and an alternative to an "ADAF" solution. Some observational implications and possible ways to distinguish these two types of flow are briefly discussed.	0	26	23
astro-ph/9809089	Phase Variability in the Optical Polarization of GRO J1655--40	We present the results of the new optical polarimetric observations of the superluminal source GRO J1655--40, carried out in July 1997, with the multichannel photopolarimeter of the Torino Observatory, using the 2.15-m telescope of Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (Argentina). The observed amount of polarization shows (mainly in the $V$ and $I$ bands) oscillations which are consistent with the orbital period of the system. This gives information about physical and geometrical properties of the binary system and confirms that the optical continuum is intrinsically polarized. The origin of the polarized flux is likely to be related to electron scattering of photons from the accretion disk.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9809119	Multiwavelength optical observations of the chromospherically active binary system MS Ser	We present here a continuation of our ongoing project of multiwavelength optical observations aimed at studying the chromosphere of active binary systems using the information provided for several optical spectroscopic features that are formed at different heights in the chromosphere (Montes et al. 1997, 1998; Sanz-Forcada et al. 1998). In this contribution we focus our study on the preliminar analysis of the active binary system MS Ser. We have taken H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ spectra in 1995 with the Coude Spectrograph at 2.2m telescope in Calar Alto, and high resolution SOFIN echelle spectra (covering H_alpha, H_beta, Na I D_{1} and D_{2}, He I D_{3}, Mg I b triplet, Ca II H & K, and Ca II infrared triplet lines) in 1998 with the 2.56m Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) in La Palma. A strong emission in the Ca II H & K and Ca II IRT lines, coming from the primary component (recently classified as K2IV) is observed. One of the Ca II H & K spectra (at orbital phase near quadrature) reveals that the secondary (G8V) also exhibit a small emission. A near complete and variable filling-in of the H_alpha and H_beta is obtained after the application of the spectral subtraction technique. We detect also some seasonal variations between these two observing runs and in comparation with our previous Ca II H & K observations taken in 1993 (Montes et al. 1995).	0	0	0

The broad band spectral capability of BeppoSAX allowed a good determination of the continuum against which the two absorption features are evident at ~ 19 and ~ 39 keV. Correcting for the gravitational redshift of a ~ 1.4 solar mass neutron star, the inferred surface magnetic field strength is B = 2.1 10E12 G that is typical for this kind of systems. We also detected an iron emission line at ~ 6.4 keV, with an equivalent width of ~ 60 eV.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9809175	Non-thermal Origin of the EUV and Soft X-rays from the Coma Cluster - Cosmic Rays in Equipartition with the Thermal Medium	The role of cosmic rays (CR) in the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies has been much debated. It may well be related to other fundamental questions, such as the mechanism which heats and virializes the intracluster medium (ICM), and the frequency at which the ICM is shocked. There is now compelling evidence both from the cluster soft excess (CSE) and the `hard-tail' emissions at energies above 10 keV, that many clusters are luminous sources of inverse-Compton (IC) emission. This is the first direct measurement of cluster CR: the technique is free from our uncertainties in the ICM magnetic field, and is not limited to the small subset of clusters which exhibit radio halos. The CSE emitting electrons fall within a crucial decade of energy where they have the least spectral evolution, and where most of the CR pressure resides. However their survival times do not date them back to the relic CR population. By using the CSE data of the Coma cluster, we demonstrate that the CR are energetically as important as the thermal ICM: the two components are in pressure equiparition. Thus, contrary to previous expectations, CR are a dominant component of the ICM, and their origin and effects should be explored. The best-fit CR spectral index is in agreement with the Galactic value.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9809258	The Gravitational Lensing in the QSO 1208+10 from the Proximity Effect in its Lyman alpha Forest	The quasar Q1208+1011 (z_{em}=3.8) is the second highest redshift double quasar ever detected. Several indications point toward it being a gravitational lensed system, although a definitive proof is still lacking. We present new evidence of its lensed nature based on the weakness of the ``proximity effect'' measured in the high resolution Lyman absorption spectrum of the QSO. A luminosity amplification as large as 22 has been derived from this analysis. Indications on the redshift of the lensing galaxy can be obtained from the analysis of the intervening heavy element absorption systems discovered in the QSO high resolution spectrum. On statistical and dynamical grounds a MgII system present at z=1.13 appears as the most likely candidate for the lensing galaxy. We compare the observed parameters with a simple isothermal model for the lens to derive the properties of the lensing galaxy. The resulting magnification factor is smaller, although marginally consistent with that derived by the analysis of the proximity effect.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9809270	Search for the optical and infrared counterpart of GRS 1758-258	We report the results of a deep search for the optical and near infrared counterpart of the microquasar source GRS1758-258. At least two possible candidate counterparts of the binary star companion have been recognized on the basis of astrometric coincidence to within 1". Our photometric study shows that the brightest of them would be consistent with a K-type giant star, while the weakest one would be a main sequence F companion. Follow up spectroscopic observations in the near infrared H and K-bands have failed so far to provide evidence for emission lines that may support an unambiguous identification. However, the proximity of these two sources to the sub-arcsec VLA radio position of GRS 1758-258 makes them deserving further attention in the future.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9809291	Galaxy Biasing: Nonlinear, Stochastic and Measurable	I describe a general formalism for galaxy biasing (Dekel & Lahav 1998) and its application to measurements of beta (=Omega^0.6/b), e.g. via direct comparisons of light and mass and via redshift distortions. The linear and deterministic relation g=b*d between the density fluctuation fields of galaxies g and mass d is replaced by the conditional distribution P(g|d) of these as random fields, smoothed at a given scale and at a given time. The mean biasing and its nonlinearity are characterized by the conditional mean <g|d>=b(d)*d and the local scatter by the conditional variance s_b^2(d). This scatter arises from hidden effects on galaxy formation and from shot noise. For applications involving second-order local moments, the biasing is defined by three natural parameters: the slope b_h of the regression of g on d (replacing b), a nonlinearity parameter b_t, and a scatter parameter s_b. The ratio of variances b_v^2 and the correlation coefficient r mix these parameters. The nonlinearity and scatter lead to underestimates of order b_t^2/b_h^2 and s_b^2/b_h^2 in the different estimators of beta, which may partly explain the range of estimates. Local stochasticity affects the redshift-distortion analysis only by limiting the useful range of scales. In this range, for linear stochastic biasing, the analysis reduces to Kaiser's formula for b_h (not b_v) independent of the scatter. The distortion analysis is affected by nonlinearity but in a weak way. Estimates of the nontrivial features of the biasing scheme are made based on simulations and toy models, and a new method for measuring them via distribution functions is proposed.	0	3	3

For a sufficiently polydisperse mixture crystallisation occurs with simultaneous fractionation. At the fluid-solid boundary, a broad fluid diameter distribution is split into a number of narrower fractions, each of which then crystallises. The number of crystalline phases increases with the overall level of polydispersity. At high densities, freezing is followed by a sequence of demixing transitions in the polydisperse crystal.	1	1	1

cs/9809016	Scoping Constructs in Logic Programming: Implementation Problems and their Solution	The inclusion of universal quantification and a form of implication in goals in logic programming is considered. These additions provide a logical basis for scoping but they also raise new implementation problems. When universal and existential quantifiers are permitted to appear in mixed order in goals, the devices of logic variables and unification that are employed in solving existential goals must be modified to ensure that constraints arising out of the order of quantification are respected. Suitable modifications that are based on attaching numerical tags to constants and variables and on using these tags in unification are described. The resulting devices are amenable to an efficient implementation and can, in fact, be assimilated easily into the usual machinery of the Warren Abstract Machine (WAM). The provision of implications in goals results in the possibility of program clauses being added to the program for the purpose of solving specific subgoals. A naive scheme based on asserting and retracting program clauses does not suffice for implementing such additions for two reasons. First, it is necessary to also support the resurrection of an earlier existing program in the face of backtracking. Second, the possibility for implication goals to be surrounded by quantifiers requires a consideration of the parameterization of program clauses by bindings for their free variables. Devices for supporting these additional requirements are described as also is the integration of these devices into the WAM. Further extensions to the machine are outlined for handling higher-order additions to the language. The ideas presented here are relevant to the implementation of the higher-order logic programming language lambda Prolog.	0	0	0
hep-ph/9809323	Oscillating Effects in the Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio Model	Phase structure of the four dimensional Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model has been investigated in two cases: 1) in nonsimply connected space-time of the form $R^3\times S^1$ (space coordinate is compactified and the length of the circle $S^1$ is $L$) with nonzero chemical potential $\mu$ and 2) in Minkowski space-time at nonzero values of $\mu,H$, where $H$ is the external magnetic field. In both cases on phase portraits of the model there are infinitly many massless chirally symmetric phases as well as massive ones with spontaneously broken chiral invariance. Such phase structure leads unavoidably to oscillations of some physical parameters at $L\to\infty$ or $H\to 0$, including magnetization, pressure and particle density of the system as well as quark condensate and critical curve of chiral phase transitions.	0	1	1

nucl-th/9809058	Isospin equilibration in relativistic heavy-ion collisions	We study the mixing and the kinetic equilibration of projectile and target nucleons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the energy regime between 150~AMeV and 2~AGeV in a coupled-channel BUU (CBUU) approach. We find that equilibrium in the projectile-target degrees of freedom is in general not reached even for large systems at low energy where elastic nucleon-nucleon collisions dominate. Inelastic nucleon excitations are more favorable for equilibration and their relative abundance increases both with energy and mass. Experimentally, the projectile/target admixture can be determined by measuring the degree of isospin equilibration in isospin asymmetric nuclear collisions. For one of the most promising systems currently under investigation, ${}^{96}_{44}{\rm Ru}+{}^{96}_{40}{\rm Zr}$, we investigate the influence of the equation of state and the inelastic in-medium cross section.	0	15	12
astro-ph/9810174	The ROSAT view of NGC 1365 and the luminous highly variable off-nuclear X-ray source NGC 1365 - X1	We present an X-ray spectral and spatial analysis of the composite starburst/Seyfert galaxy NGC 1365. Excellent fits of the ROSAT PSPC spectrum are obtained by combining a soft thermal component with a hard powerlaw. The hard component may be either seen directly or can be explained by scattering of the AGN powerlaw at circumnuclear warm high-column-density gas. A compilation of the multi-wavelength properties of NGC 1365 and comparison with hard X-ray selected AGNs shows that the hard component of NGC 1365 is too faint compared to its broad Balmer line components challenging simple unified models. According to analytical estimates, supernova driven outflow can fully account for the X-ray luminosity in the Raymond-Smith component if the observed IR emission is mainly provided by the central starburst. We do not find obvious optical counterparts for three faint PSPC sources south of the nucleus. In particular, there is no coincidence with the two supernovae reported in NGC 1365. With the ROSAT HRI data, we have precisely located the extraordinary southwest X-ray source NGC1365-X1 which falls on one of the subordinate spiral arms. The source is found to be highly variable (a factor about 10) on the timescale of months. Intrinsic to NGC 1365, its huge luminosity makes it exceptional among stellar X-ray sources. At present, the most likely interpretation seems to be an ultra-powerful X-ray binary.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9810331	Multiwavelength study of the starburst galaxy NGC7714. I: Ultraviolet-Optical spectroscopy	We have studied the physical conditions in the central 300 pc of the proto-typical starburst galaxy NGC 7714. Our analysis is based on ultraviolet spectroscopy with the HST+GHRS and ground-based optical observations.The data are interpreted using evolutionary models optimized for young starburst regions. The massive stellar population is derived in a self-consistent way using the continuum and stellar absorption lines in the ultraviolet and the nebular emission line optical spectrum. The central starburst has an age of about 4.5 Myr, with little evidence for an age spread. Wolf-Rayet features at the ultraviolet indicates a stellar population of $\sim$ 2000 Wolf-Rayet stars. The overall properties of the newly formed stars are quite similar to those derived, e.g., in 30 Doradus. A standard Salpeter IMF is consistent with all observational constraints. We find evidence for spatial structure within the central 300 pc sampled. Therefore it is unlikely that the nucleus of NGC 7714 hosts a single star cluster exceeding the properties of other known clusters. Contrary to previous suggestions, we find no evidence for a nuclear supernova rate that would significantly exceed the total disk-integrated rate. About one supernova event per century is predicted.	0	2	2

astro-ph/9810410	Particle acceleration and high-frequency (X-ray and $γ$-ray) emission in the jets of active galactic nuclei	It is suggested that the outflowing plasma in the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is inhomogeneous and consists of separate clouds. These clouds are strongly magnetized and move away from the central engine at relativistic speeds. The clouds interact with an ambient medium which is assumed to be at rest. In the process of this interaction, particles of the ambient medium are accelerated to high energies at the cloud front and flow ahead of the front. It is shown that the radiation of the accelerated particles may be responsible for the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission from AGN jets. TeV $\gamma$-ray emission is generated in the inner parts of AGN jets where the Lorentz factor of the cloud fronts is $\Gamma_0\geq 30$, while GeV $\gamma$-ray emission emanates from the outer parts of AGN jets where $\Gamma_0$ is $\sim 10$.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9810426	On the Cosmological Evolution of the Luminosity Function and the Accretion Rate of Quasars	We consider a class of models for the redshift evolution (between $0\lsim z \lsim 4$) of the observed optical and X-ray quasar luminosity functions (LFs), with the following assumptions: (i) the mass-function of dark matter halos follows the Press-Schechter theory, (ii) the black hole (BH) mass scales linearly with the halo mass, (iii) quasars have a constant universal lifetime, and (iv) a thin accretion disk provides the optical luminosity of quasars, while the X-ray/optical flux ratio is calibrated from a sample of observed quasars. The mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ onto quasar BHs is a free parameter of the models, that we constrain using the observed LFs. The accretion rate $\dot M$ inferred from either the optical or X-ray data under these assumptions generally decreases as a function of cosmic time from $z \simeq 4$ to $z \simeq 0$. We find that a comparable accretion rate is inferred from the X-ray and optical LF only if the X-ray/optical flux ratio decreases with BH mass. Near $z\simeq 0$, $\dot M$ drops to substantially sub-Eddington values at which advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) exist. Such a decline of $\dot M$, possibly followed by a transition to radiatively inefficient ADAFs, could explain both the absence of bright quasars in the local universe and the faintness of accreting BHs at the centers of nearby galaxies. We argue that a decline of the accretion rate of the quasar population is indeed expected in cosmological structure formation models.	0	54	54
astro-ph/9810451	The Magnetic Association of Coronal Bright Points	Several coronal bright points identified in a quiet region of the Sun from SOHO/EIT Fe XII images are found to have a time evolution from birth to decay which is extremely well correlated with the rise and fall of magnetic flux as determined from photospheric magnetograms made with the SOHO/MDI instrument. Radiative losses of the bright points are found to be much less than conductive losses but the sum of the two is comparable with the available energy of the associated magnetic field. Several small `network flares' occur during the lifetimes of these bright points, emphasizing the strong connection of such events with the magnetic field.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9810462	Fringe Visibility Estimators for the Palomar Testbed Interferometer	Visibility estimators and their performance are presented for use with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI). One operational mode of PTI is single-baseline visibility measurement using pathlength modulation with synchronous readout by a NICMOS-3 infrared array. Visibility is estimated from the fringe quadratures, either incoherently, or using source phase referencing to provide a longer coherent integration time. The visibility estimators differ those used with photon-counting detectors in order to account for biases attributable to detector offsets and read noise. The performance of these estimators is affected not only by photon noise, but also by the detector read noise and errors in estimating the bias corrections, which affect the incoherent and coherent estimators differently. Corrections for visibility loss in the coherent estimators using the measured tracking jitter are also presented.	0	4	4
chao-dyn/9810007	Phenomenology of Globally Coupled Map Lattice and its Extension	We revisit the globally coupled map lattice (GCML) and also propose a new extended globally coupled map lattice (EGCML) with an inverse power law interaction. In GCML we clarify the mechanism of the basic posi-nega switch in the two-cluster regime. We show that there is a natural mechanism in GCML which guarantees no mixing of maps across their mean field in the chaotic transient process. In the turbulent regime of GCML there is a prominent period three window. In the correlator analysis we also find a remnant of periodic motion of quasi-clusters with high rate mixing almost everywhere in the turbulent regime of the large-size GCML. The so-called hidden coherence is the most modest remnant. The EGCML shares the same intriguing properties with GCML and exhibits an amazing spatial cluster formation during the chaotic transient process. An analytic approach is proposed which relates the periodicity manifestation in the turbulent regime of GCML to the periodic window of a single logistic map.	0	3	0

cond-mat/9810193	Kinetic growth of field-oriented chains in dipolar colloidal solutions	Experimental studies on the irreversible growth of field-induced chains of dipolar particles suggest an asymptotic power-law behavior of several relevant quantities. We introduce a Monte Carlo model of chain growth that explicitly incorporates the anisotropic diffusion characteristic of a rod-like object. Assuming a simple power-law form for the mean cluster size, $S(t) \sim t^z$, the results of our model are in good agreement with the experimental measurements of the dynamic exponent $z$. Nevertheless, an alternative scenario, including logarithmic corrections to the standard power-law behavior, provides a better and more insightful interpretation of the anomalous dynamic exponent. In contrast to some experimental findings, we do not observe any dependence of the exponents on the volume fraction of particles $\phi$. Finite-size effects are also explored by simulating very long time evolutions or highly concentrated systems. Two different behaviors are found, namely, saturation and a crossover to a quasi one-dimensional regime.	1	0	0

The existence of the strong correlation between instantons and QCD-monopoles in the abelian gauge was already shown by both analytic and numerical works including the Monte Carlo simulation. Their interrelation brings us a conjecture that the presence of QCD-monopoles plays a considerable role on the $U_{A}(1)$ anomaly. We find an evidence for our conjecture on a determination of the fermionic zero modes of the Dirac operator in both the ``monopole removed'' gauge configuration and the ``photon removed'' gauge configuration.	0	13	8

It is shown that within the standard perturbation approach the one-loop dispersion equation, besides the ordinary one-particle excitation, has four new solutions. The additional excitations are gauge-dependent and two of them have nonphysical signs of residues in the propagator poles. The temperature evolution of the solutions is investigated and it is shown that the use of effective propagators leaves no more than one additional mode which becomes propagating at $T \bolpor 10M$, when the gauge invariance is restored. The other three modes, including those with nonphysical residues in the propagator poles, are always strongly damped, thus the thermal effects do not produce pathologies in QED_{3+1}.	0	1	0

nucl-th/9810055	Effective field theory for lambda-sigma^0 mixing in nuclear matter	We extend the effective field theory approach which successfully describes ordinary nuclei and nuclear matter to incorporate strangeness in nuclear structure. Central object is a chiral effective Lagrangian involving the baryon octet, the Goldstone boson octet, the vector meson octet and a light scalar singlet. According to the rules of effective field theory, we include all interaction terms (up to a given order of truncation) that are consistent with the underlying symmetries of QCD. We develop a mean-field approximation and study nuclear matter as a simple model for multi-strange systems. A D-type Yukawa coupling between baryons and vector mesons leads to lambda-sigma^0 flavor mixing in the nuclear medium. We study flavor oscillations in the nuclear matter ground state which are closely related to the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations.	0	12	9
astro-ph/9811067	Comment on "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing: Evidence for Maximal $ν_μ\leftrightarrow ν_τ$ Mixing in Super Kamiokande?"	The paper "Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing: Evidence for Maximal $\nu_\mu \leftrightarrow \nu_\tau$ Mixing in Super Kamiokande?" by X. Shi and G. M. Fuller (astro-ph/9810075) discusses the cosmological implications of the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_s$ solution to the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. It incorrectly concludes that a lower bound on the $\nu_\tau$ mass of 15 eV is needed in order for the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_s$ oscillations to be consistent with a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis upper bound on the effective number of flavours of 3.3. Since such a large $\nu_\tau$ mass is disfavoured from large scale structure formation considerations, the strong, but incorrect, conclusion is made that cosmology favours the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ solution to the atmospheric neutrino problem. We explain the nature of the error. We conclude that cosmology is, at present, consistent with both the $\nu_\mu \to \nu_s$ and $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ possibilities.	0	15	3
astro-ph/9811093	The enhancement and decrement of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect towards the ROSAT Cluster RXJ0658-5557	We report simultaneous observations at 1.2 and 2 mm, with a double channel photometer on the SEST Telescope, of the X-ray cluster RXJ0658-5557 in search for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (S-Z). The S-Z data were analyzed using the relativistically correct expression for the Comptonization parameter and we find from the detected decrement (2.60 +/- 0.79) ~ 10^{-4}, which is consistent with that computed using the X-ray (ROSAT and ASCA) observations. The uncertainty includes contributions due to statistical uncertainty in the detection and systematics and calibration. The 1.2 {mm} channel data alone gives rise to a larger Comptonization parameter and this result is discussed in terms of contamination from foreground sources and/or dust in the cluster or from a possible systematic effect. We then make use of the combined analysis of the ROSAT and ASCA X-ray satellite observations to determine an isothermal model for the S-Z surface brightness. Since the cluster is asymmetrical and probably in a merging process, models are only approximate. The associated uncertainty can, however, be estimated by exploring a set of alternative models. We then find as the global uncertainty on the Comptonization parameter a factor of 1.3. Combining the S-Z and the X-ray measurements, we determine a value for the Hubble constant. The 2 mm data are consistent with H_0(q_0 = 1/2)= 53^{+38}_{-28} km/s Mpc^{-1}, where the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in models of the X-ray plasma halo.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9811095	Dark Matter and Gas Concentrations in the NGC 4532 / DDO 137 System	Neutral hydrogen synthesis mapping of NGC 4532 and DDO 137, a pair of Sm galaxies on the edge of the Virgo cluster, is used to determine rotation curves for each of the galaxies and to resolve the structure and kinematics of three distinct HI concentrations embedded in an extended envelope of diffuse HI discovered in earlier Arecibo studies of the system. The HI masses of the three concentrations do not appear to be sufficient for them to be self-gravitating; however, their HImasses and dynamical masses are very similar to those of faint Im galaxies in the Virgo cluster. The peak HI column density of each of the clouds is close to the star formation threshold, but CCD images in B and R reveal no trace of stars nor star formation. If the system is gravitationally bound and in Virial equilibrium, we find its total mass to be ten times that within the outermost HI contours of the individual galaxies and clouds. Thirty-seven percent of the total HI lies outside the boundaries of the individual galaxies as determined by the VLA mapping; 28% cannot be ascribed to either galaxy nor to the discrete concentrations. One possible way to account for the velocity field and the large quantity of diffuse gas is to assume that DDO 137, the gas concentrations and other apparent tidal features are due to gas infall into clumps within the dark matter potential of the group, and that prior to the interaction the group consisted of an irregular galaxy (NGC 4532) and a large, star-poor HI cloud like HI 1225+01 (Giovanelli et al. 1991).	0	1	1

astro-ph/9811126	Dust in an extremely metal-poor galaxy: mid-infrared observations of SBS 0335-052	The metal deficient (Z = Z_sun/41) Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy (BCD) SBS 0335-052 was observed with ISOCAM between 5 and 17 mic. With a L_12mic/L_B ratio of 2.15, the galaxy is unexpectedly bright in the mid-infrared for such a low-metallicity object. The mid-infrared spectrum shows no sign of the Unidentified Infrared Bands, which we interpret as an effect of the destruction of their carriers by the very high UV energy density in SBS 0335-052. The spectral energy distribution (SED) is dominated by a very strong continuum which makes the ionic lines of [SIV] and [NeIII] very weak. From 5 to 17 mic, the SED can be fitted with a grey-body spectrum, modified by an extinction law similar to that observed toward the Galactic Center, with an optical depth of A_V~19-21 mag. Such a large optical depth implies that a large fraction (as much as ~ 75%) of the current star-formation activity in SBS 0335-052 is hidden by dust with a mass between 3x10^3 M_sun and 5x10^5 M_sun. Silicate grains are present as silicate extinction bands at 9.7 and 18 mic can account for the unusual shape of the MIR spectrum of SBS 0335-052. It is remarkable that such a nearly primordial environment contains as much dust as galaxies which are 10 times more metal-rich. If the hidden star formation in SBS 0335-052 is typical of young galaxies at high redshifts, then the cosmic star formation rate derived from UV/optical fluxes would be underestimated.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9811248	Accuracy of Mesh Based Cosmological Hydrocodes: Tests and Corrections	We perform a variety of tests to determine the numerical resolution of the cosmological TVD eulerian code developed by Ryu et al (1993). Tests include 512^3 and 256^3 simulations of a Pk=k^{-1} spectrum to check for self-similarity and comparison of results with those from higher resolution SPH and grid-based calculations (Frenk et al 1998). We conclude that in regions where density gradients are not produced by shocks the code degrades resolution with a Gaussian smoothing (radius) length of 1.7 cells. At shock caused gradients (for which the code was designed) the smoothing length is 1.1 cells. Finally, for \beta model fit clusters, we can approximately correct numerical resolution by the transformation R^2_{core}\to R^2_{core}-(C\Delta l)^2, where \Delta l is the cell size and C=1.1-1.7. When we use these corrections on our previously published computations for the SCDM and \Lambda CDM models we find luminosity weighted, zero redshift, X-ray cluster core radii of (210\pm 86, 280\pm 67)h^{-1}kpc, respectively, which are marginally consistent with observed (Jones & Forman 1992) values of 50-200h^{-1}kpc. Using the corrected core radii, the COBE normalized SCDM model predicts the number of bright L_x>10^{43}erg/s clusters too high by a factor of \sim 20 and the \Lambda CDM model is consistent with observations.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9811475	Probing the Large Scale Structure with QSOs and radio-galaxies	QSOs and radio-galaxies, together with the CMB, ``normal'' galaxies and clusters, represent the main source of information about the origin and evolution of the Large Scale Structure. They can be used either directly, as tracers of the density peaks, or as cosmic lighthouses, probing the Universe along the line of sight with their conspicuous flow of photons. The amplitude of the QSO clustering has been measured to be $r_o \simeq 6 \hmpc$ at $z\sim 2$ and appears to increase with redshift. These properties are consistent with a scenario in which the quasars, with a lifetime of $t \sim 10^8 yr$, sparsely sample halos of mass greater than $M_{min} \sim 10^{12}-10^{13} h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. Radio-galaxies are found to cluster on similar scales. The study of QSO and radio-galaxy environments is in qualitative agreement with their clustering properties. Absorption-line systems observed in high-resolution spectra of QSOs show structure, including voids/underdensities and overdensities, from the smallest scales to tens of Mpc. QSO pairs, groups and lenses allow us to get a 3-D glimpse of the absorbers, providing invaluable information about their size, ionization, mass. Great progress in this field is expected from the new instrumentation coming into operation at the 8-m class telescopes.	0	1	1

Vacancies and interstitials renormalize the long-wavelength bulk and tilt elastic moduli. Dislocation loops lead to the vanishing of the long-wavelength shear modulus. The coupling to vacancies and interstitials - which are always present in the liquid state - allows dislocations to relax stresses by climbing out of their glide plane. Surprisingly, this mechanism does not yield any further independent renormalization of the tilt and compressional moduli at long wavelengths. The long wavelength properties of the resulting state are formally identical to that of the ``flux-line hexatic'' that is a candidate ``normal'' hexatically ordered vortex liquid state.	1	10	1

We combine all the dynamical variables into a single (d+1)X(d+1+n)--dimensional matrix potential which linearly transforms under the action of these symmetry transformations in a transparent SO(2,d-1) X SO(2,d-1+n) way, where n is the number of Abelian vector fields. We formulate the most general solution generation technique based on the use of these symmetries and show that they form an invariance group of the general Israel--Wilson--Perj'es class of solutions.	0	27	18
hep-th/9811217	Heterotic String/F-theory Duality from Mirror Symmetry	We use local mirror symmetry in type IIA string compactifications on Calabi-Yau n+1 folds $X_{n+1}$ to construct vector bundles on (possibly singular) elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau n-folds Z_n. The interpretation of these data as valid classical solutions of the heterotic string compactified on Z_n proves F-theory/heterotic duality at the classical level. Toric geometry is used to establish a systematic dictionary that assigns to each given toric n+1-fold $X_{n+1}$ a toric n fold Z_n together with a specific family of sheafs on it. This allows for a systematic construction of phenomenologically interesting d=4 N=1 heterotic vacua, e.g. on deformations of the tangent bundle, with grand unified and SU(3)\times SU(2) gauge groups. As another application we find non-perturbative gauge enhancements of the heterotic string on singular Calabi-Yau manifolds and new non-perturbative dualities relating heterotic compactifications on different manifolds.	0	67	67
hep-th/9811232	Partial breaking of global D=4 supersymmetry, constrained superfields, and 3-brane actions	We show that the connection between partial breaking of supersymmetry and nonlinear actions is not accidental and has to do with constraints that lead directly to nonlinear actions of the Born-Infeld type. We develop a constrained superfield approach that gives a universal way of deriving and using these actions. In particular, we find the manifestly supersymmetric form of the action of the 3-brane in 6-dimensional space in terms of N=1 superfields by using the tensor multiplet as a tool. We explain the relation between the Born-Infeld action and the model of partial N=2 supersymmetry breaking by a dual D-term. We represent the Born-Infeld action in a novel form quadratic in the gauge field strengths by introducing two auxiliary complex scalar fields; this makes duality covariance and the connection with the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the action very transparent. We also suggest a general procedure for deriving manifestly duality symmetric actions, explaining in a systematic way relations between previously discussed Lorentz covariant and noncovariant actions.	0	157	156

math/9811011	Two examples concerning almost continuous functions	We construct, under the assumption that union of less than continuum many meager subsets of R is meager in R, an additive connectivity function f:R-->R with Cantor intermediate value property which is not almost continuous. This gives a partial answer to a question of D. Banaszewski. We also show that every extendable function g:R-->R with a dense graph satisfies the following stronger version of the SCIVP property: for every a<b and every perfect set K between g(a) and g(b) there is a perfect subset C of (a,b) such that g[C] subset K and g|C is continuous strictly increasing. This property is used to construct a ZFC example of an additive almost continuous function f:R-->R which has the strong Cantor intermediate value property but is not extendable. This answers a question of H. Rosen. This also generalizes Rosen's result that a similar (but not additive) function exists under the assumption of the continuum hypothesis.	0	0	0

Exact stationary solutions of the master equation for the diagonal elements of the density matrix in the Fock basis are found in the case of completely saturated two-photon emission. If two-photon processes dominate over single-photon ones, the stationary state is a mixture of phase averaged even and odd coherent states.	0	1	1

We give a general construction which applies to any metric space equipped with a sigma-finite measure and produces the desired result in all of the above cases. It also applies to an important class of Dirichlet spaces, where, however, the known first-order differential calculus in general differs from ours (although the two are related).	0	2	0

cond-mat/9811284	The Magnetic Origin of d-Wave High-Tc Superconductivity from Tunneling Spectroscopy Measurements on Bi2212 Single Crystals	The complete scenario of high-Tc superconductivity based on experimental data from electron-tunneling spectroscopy on underdoped, overdoped and Ni-doped Bi2212 single crystals using a break-junction technique is presented. There are two different types of superconductivity in cuprates: superconductivity due to pairing of spinons on charged stripes and magnetic superconductivity mediated by spin-waves. The coherent state of the spinon superconductivity is established via the magnetic superconductivity. In NCCO, there is only the spinon superconductivity and the coherent state is established due to the Josephson coupling between charged stripes. Below Tc, we observe four different gaps, namely, (i) a SDW gap due to antiferromagnetic correlations; (ii) a superconducting gap due to spinon pairing; (iii) a d-wave magnetic superconducting gap, and (iv) a small superconducting gap most likely having g-wave symmetry. We show that the d-wave superconductivity is mediated by spin-waves and the magnitude of the superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons is larger than the magnitude of the d-wave gap, however, the d-wave gap is more intense. The superconducting gap due to pairing of spinons most likely has a s-wave symmetry. The maximum magnitudes of the SDW, the spinon and d-wave gaps are located at (p/2, p/2), (p/2, p/2) and (p, 0) on the Fermi surface, respectively. The d-g-wave superconductivity mediated by spin-waves can be considered as a pairing of magnetic polarons. We formulate a theorem for cuprates by analogy with the Anderson's theorem for classical superconductors. The presented model of high-Tc superconductivity naturally explains other experimental data.	1	4	3

The Hall anomaly and the first-order vortex-lattice melting transition are observed simultaneously. Changes in the dynamic behavior of the vortex solid and liquid are correlated with features of the Hall conductivity sxy. With the magnetic field oriented at an angle from the twin-boundaries, the Hall conductivity sharply decreases toward large negative values at the vortex-lattice melting transition.	1	6	5

Then the Mordell-Weil group E(H) is an O_K-module, and its structure denpends on its Steinitz class St(E), which is studied here. In partucular, when D is a prime number, it is proved that St(E)=1 if D\equiv 3 (mod 4); and St(E)=[P]^t if D\equiv 1 (mod 4), where [P] is the ideal class of K represented by prime factor P of 2 in K, t is a fixed integer. General structures are also discussed for St(E) and for modules over Dedekind domain. These results develop the results by D. Dummit and W.

The similarity of far-infrared luminous, gas-rich high redshift radio galaxies and local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs) is discussed. Given that local ULIGs rapidly convert most of their gas reservoir into stars, far-infrared luminous high-z radio galaxies are likely undergoing immense bursts of star formation, possibly accounting for a large fraction of the final stellar populations in these systems. These results are discussed in the context of formation scenarios of massive galaxies.	0	0	0

hep-th/9802172	Entropy Defined, Entropy Increase and Decoherence Understood, and Some Black-Hole Puzzles Solved	Statistical mechanics explains thermodynamics in terms of (quantum) mechanics by equating the entropy of a microstate of a closed system with the logarithm of the number of microstates in the macrostate to which it belongs, but the question `what is a macrostate?' has never been answered except in a vague, subjective, way. However Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation led to a formula for black hole entropy with no subjective element. In this letter, we argue from this result, together with the assumption that `black hole thermodynamics is just ordinary thermodynamics applied to black holes', that a macrostate for a general (quantum gravitational) closed system is an equivalence class of matter-gravity microstates with the same expectation values for the matter degrees of freedom alone. Not only does this finally answer the question `what is entropy?', but it also predicts the equality of the thermodynamic entropy of a black hole with the matter and the gravity entropy-like quantities derived from the Euclidean path integral. Furthermore it gives us a clear glimpse of an ultimate synthesis of quantum theory and gravity in which we see that (a) gravity acts as a universal environment, thus predicting that, if the initial state of the universe is unentangled, its entropy must go on increasing forever, (b) the gravitational field has degrees of freedom, but no observables, thus enabling gravity to perform the trick of providing an objective continual process of decoherence. All the above rests on the validity of unitarity. The `information-loss puzzle' had raised doubts about that. But we suggest a resolution for this puzzle.	0	18	3

cond-mat/9810056	Photophysical Properties in C60 and Higher Fullerenes	The optical excitations in C$_{60}$ and higher fullerenes, including isomers of C$_{76}$, C$_{78}$, and C$_{84}$, are theoretically investigated. We use a tight binding model with long-range Coulomb interactions, treated by the Hartree-Fock and configuration-interaction methods. We find that the optical excitations in the energy region smaller than about 4 eV have most of their amplitudes at the pentagons. The oscillator strengths of projected absorption almost accord with those of the total absorption. Next, off-resonant third order susceptibilities are investigated. We find that third order susceptibilities of higher fullerenes are a few times larger than those of C$_{60}$. The magnitude of nonlinearity increases as the optical gap decreases in higher fullerenes. The nonlinearity is nearly proportional to the fourth power of the carbon number when the onsite Coulomb repulsion is $2t$ or $4t$, $t$ being the nearest neighbor hopping integral. This result, indicating important roles of Coulomb interactions, agrees with quantum chemical calculations of higher fullerenes.	1	0	0

hep-ph/9810392	S_3 and the L=1 Baryons in the Quark Model and the Chiral Quark Model	The S_3 symmetry corresponding to permuting the positions of the quarks within a baryon allows us to study the 70-plet of L=1 baryons without an explicit choice for the spatial part of the quark wave functions: given a set of operators with definite transformation properties under the spin-flavor group SU(3) x SU(2) and under this S_3, the masses of the baryons can be expressed in terms of a small number of unknown parameters which are fit to the observed L=1 baryon mass spectrum. This approach is applied to study both the quark model and chiral constituent quark model. The latter theory leads to a set of mass perturbations which more satisfactorily fits the observed L=1 baryon mass spectrum (though we can say nothing, within our approach, about the physical reasonableness of the parameters in the fit). Predictions for the mixing angles and the unobserved baryon masses are given for both models as well as a discussion of specific baryons.	0	45	27

A further mixing episode occurs just after the RGB bump, in agreement with the predictions by Charbonnel (1994, A&A, 282, 811; 1995, ApJ, 453, L41) The O-Na anti-correlation, typical signature observed amongst globular cluster giants, is not present amongst field stars.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9812118	Two-component galaxy models: phase-space constraints	The properties of the analitycal phase--space distribution function of two-component spherical self-consistent galaxy models, where one density distribution follows the Hernquist profile, and the other a gamma=0 model, with different total masses and core radii (H0 models), presented in Ciotti (1998), are here summarized. A variable amount of radial Osipkov-Merritt orbital anisotropy is allowed in both components. The necessary and sufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy in order to correspond to a model where each one of the two distinct components has a positive DF (the so-called model consistency) are analytically derived, together with some results on the more general problem of the consistency of two-component gamma1+gamma2 models. The possibility to add in a consistent way a black hole at the center of radially anisotropic gamma models is also discussed. In particular, it is proved that a globally isotropic Hernquist component is consistent for any mass and core radius of the superimposed gamma=0 halo; on the contrary, only a maximum value of the core radius is allowed to the gamma=0 component when a Hernquist halo is added. The combined effect of halo concentration and orbital anisotropy is successively investigated.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9812149	MHD waves as a source of matter density fluctuations within solar interior	It is shown that in the presence of a background magnetic field within solar interior a cavity for low frequency MHD eigen modes (with periods 1-10 days) near equatorial plane can arise. The lower boundary of the cavity coincides with the centre of the Sun while the upper one corresponds to the Alfven resonant layer where high accumulation of wave energy takes place. The localization and the width of the Alfven resonance layer are determined by: (i) the node number of eigen modes n = 1, 2,..., (ii) by the angle of oblique propagation of waves with respect to the magnetic field, and (iii) by a low magnitude of the background magnetic field itself, B=1-100 G. The amplitude of eigen oscillations in a resonant layer determines the density fluctuation value that is restricted through the imaginary part of eigen frequences. For large node numbers n>>1 there appear many narrow resonant layers where a neutrino propagates through a large density fluctuation \delta\rho/\rho with the oscillation length that is much bigger than the width of a resonant layer. It is shown that neutrino crosses many such bumps on the exponential background profile that motivates to consider these MHD waves as a plausible matter noise for the MSW solution to the Solar Neutrino Problem (SNP).	0	4	1
astro-ph/9812313	Cosmological Tracking Solutions	A substantial fraction of the energy density of the universe may consist of quintessence in the form of a slowly-rolling scalar field. Since the energy density of the scalar field generally decreases more slowly than the matter energy density, it appears that the ratio of the two densities must be set to a special, infinitesimal value in the early universe in order to have the two densities nearly coincide today. Recently, we introduced the notion of tracker fields to avoid this initial conditions problem. In the paper, we address the following questions: What is the general condition to have tracker fields? What is the relation between the matter energy density and the equation-of-state of the universe imposed by tracker solutions? And, can tracker solutions explain why quintessence is becoming important today rather than during the early universe?	0	919	529
astro-ph/9812412	Deep counts of submillimeter galaxies	We present the counts of luminous submillimeter (sub-mm) galaxies from an analysis of our survey of the distant Universe through lensing clusters, which uses massive cluster lenses with well-constrained mass models to magnify the background sky. This both increases the sensitivity and reduces the effects of source confusion. Accurate lens models are used to correct the observed sub-mm source counts. The associated uncertainties do not dominate the final errors. We derive counts by two independent methods: a direct inversion of the observed sources, corrected individually for lens amplification; and a Monte-Carlo simulation of our observations using a parametric model for the background counts, which is folded through the lens models and incompleteness estimates to determine best-fitting values of the count parameters. Both methods agree well and confirm the robustness of our analysis. Detections that are optically identified with galaxies in the lensing clusters are removed prior to our analysis, and the results are insensitive both to the details of the correction and to the redshift distribution of the detections. We present 850-micron counts between 0.5 and 8 mJy. The most accurate count is determined at 1 mJy: 7900 +- 3000 deg^-2, including both Poisson and systematic errors. These are the deepest sub-mm counts published, and are not subject to source confusion because the detected galaxies are separated and magnified by the lens. Down to the 0.5-mJy limit, the resolved 850-micron background radiation intensity is (0.5 +- 0.2) nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}, comparable to the current COBE estimate of the background, and so the bulk of the 850-micron background radiation originated in distant ultraluminous galaxies.	0	53	52
astro-ph/9812453	On the Azimuthal Stability of Shock Waves around Black Holes	Analytical studies and numerical simulations of time dependent axially symmetric flows onto black holes have shown that it is possible to produce stationary shock waves with a stable position both for ideal inviscid and for moderately viscous accretion disks. We perform several two dimensional numerical simulations of accretion flows in the equatorial plane to study shock stability against non-axisymmetric azimuthal perturbations. We find a peculiar new result. A very small perturbation seems to produce an instability as it crosses the shock, but after some small oscillations, the shock wave suddenly transforms into an asymmetric closed pattern, and it stabilizes with a finite radial extent, despite the inflow and outflow boundary conditions are perfectly symmetric. The main characteristics of the final flow are: 1) The deformed shock rotates steadily without any damping. It is a permanent feature and the thermal energy content and the emitted energy vary periodically with time. 2) This behavior is also stable against further perturbations. 3) The average shock is still very strong and well defined, and its average radial distance is somewhat larger than that of the original axially symmetric circular shock. 4) Shocks obtained with larger angular momentum exhibit more frequencies and beating phenomena. 5) The oscillations occur in a wide range of parameters, so this new effect may have relevant observational consequences, like (quasi) periodic oscillations, for the accretion of matter onto black holes. Typical time scales for the periods are 0.01 and 1000 seconds for black holes with 10 and 1 million solar mass, respectively.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9812469	Interstellar Depletion onto Very Small Dust Grains	We consider the depletion of elements from the interstellar gas onto a population of very small dust grains. Adopting a grain model in which of order 4% of the cosmic C abundance is in grains with radii <= 10 Angstroms, we find that the rate of accretion onto these grains is adequately fast to account for the observed large depletions of elements like Ti, without invoking unreasonably high rates of mass transfer between interstellar phases or low grain destruction rates. If these grains are composed of arene rings, then only a limited number of metal atoms can be locked up in them. The depletion would be quenched when this limit is reached, unless there is a mechanism for transferring the metals to larger grains and refreshing the very small grain population, for example by grain coagulation and shattering in the diffuse ISM. If Fe depletes onto the very small grains, then for reasonable coagulation rates there is at least one metal atom per five C atoms in the very small grain population. Furthermore, approximately 60% of the cosmic Fe is associated with the carbonaceous grain population. It is unclear whether this scenario is compatible with observations. However, if there is another population of very small grains, with a large capacity for holding Fe atoms, it might be the sink for the most heavily depleted elements.	0	0	0

This symmetry class can be realised in a dirty, gapless superconductor in which time reversal symmetry for orbital motion is broken, but spin rotation symmetry is intact. We find a direct transition between two insulating phases with quantized Hall conductances of zero and two for the conserved quasiparticles. The energy of quasiparticles acts as a relevant, symmetry-breaking field at the critical point, which splits the direct transition into two conventional plateau transitions.	1	20	5

We consider the tight-binding dielectric matrix with two electronic bands per chain, determine the corresponding hybridized collective modes, and show that three among them are considerably softened due to strong dipole-dipole and monopole-dipole interactions. By this we explain the unusual low frequency optical activity of TTF-TCNQ, including the observed 10meV anomaly. The softening of the modes also explains the cohesion of the mixed-stack lattice, the fractional charge transfer almost independent of the material, and the formation of the charged sheets in some compounds.	1	0	0

This provides a proof of the following properties: i) there is a residual ground-state entropy per spin equal to 2^{1/4}; ii) there is a singlet-triplet gap as long as the coupling between the tetrahedra is smaller than the internal one. These properties are compared to available results on the pyrochlore lattice.	1	2	2

A tricritical point separates the line of first order transitions from Heisenberg critical behavior at higher temperatures. Sufficiently strong quenched disorder suppresses the first order transition via the appearance of a critical endpoint.

The height and width of the peak depend on the collimation angle $\vartheta_c$. The height of the peak for given $\vartheta_c$ is proportional to N.

In the remaining kinematically accessible regions we present total event rates for topologies which require further studies, i.e. estimations of the corresponding efficiencies: various 4 charged fermion final states with missing energy, possibly with displaced vertices due to a long lifetime of the NLSP, the second lightest neutralino.

We present firstly a generalization of D=4 Ferber-Shirafuji (FS) model with fundamental bosonic spinors and tensorial central charge coordinates. The model contains four fermionic coordinates and possesses three kappa- symmetries thus providing the BPS configuration preserving 3/4 of the target space supersymmetries. We show that the physical degrees of freedom (8 real bosonic and 1 real Grassmann variable) of our model can be described by OSp(8|1) supertwistor. Then we propose a higher dimensional generalization of our model with one real fundamental bosonic spinor. D=10 model describes massless superparticle with composite tensorial central charges and in D=11 we obtain 0-superbrane model with nonvanishing mass which is generated dynamically. The introduction of D=11 Lorentz harmonics provides the possibility to construct massless D=11 superparticle model which can be formulated in a way preserving 1/2, 17/32, 18/32,..., 31/32 supersymmetries. In a special case we obtain the twistor-like formulation of the usual massless D=11 superparticle proposed recently by Bergshoeff and Townsend.	0	21	21

We give a simple proof of a formula of Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson \cite{GKM} for the image of the map $i^*$.	0	5	1
math/9812020	Combinatorial aspects of multiple zeta values	Multiple zeta values (MZVs, also called Euler sums or multiple harmonic series) are nested generalizations of the classical Riemann zeta function evaluated at integer values. The fact that an integral representation of MZVs obeys a shuffle product rule allows the possibility of a combinatorial approach to them. Using this approach we prove a longstanding conjecture of Don Zagier about MZVs with certain repeated arguments. We also prove a similar cyclic sum identity. Finally, we present extensive computational evidence supporting an infinite family of conjectured MZV identities that simultaneously generalize the Zagier identity.	0	12	4
math/9812041	Nearly Kahlerian Embeddings of Symplectic Manifolds	Given an integral symplectic manifold, we construct a family of "coherent state" maps into complex projective space. The maps are built from sections of the tensor powers of a hermitian line bundle whose curvature is a multiple of the symplectic form. We show that this family is an almost-complex version of the Kodiara embedding. That is, the maps are embeddings which are approximately pseudo-holomorphic.	0	3	0

Moreover, the maximum number of pairwise distinct, non-overlapping Ferrers shapes that can be packed in such a rectangle is only $\Theta(p(n)/ \log n).$	0	0	0

The package includes facilities for conversion between q-series and q-products and finding algebraic relations between q-series. Andrews found an algorithm for converting a q-series into a product. We provide an implementation. As an application we are able to effectively find finite q-product factorisations when they exist thus answering a question of Andrews.

nucl-th/9812035	A Relativistic Symmetry in Nuclei	We review the status of a quasi - degenerate doublets in nuclei, called pseudospin doublets, which were discovered about thirty years ago and the origins of which have remained a mystery, until recently. We show that pseudospin doublets originate from an SU(2) symmetry of the Dirac Hamiltonian which occurs when the scalar and vector potentials are opposite in sign but equal in magnitude. Furthermore, we survey the evidence that pseudospin symmetry is approximately conserved for a Dirac Hamiltonian with realistic scalar and vector potentials. We briefly discuss the relationship of pseudospin symmetry with chiral symmetry and the implications of pseudospin symmetry for the antinucleon spectrum in nuclei.	0	62	33
astro-ph/9812157	The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale. XV. A Cepheid Distance to the Fornax Cluster and Its Implications	Using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 37 long-period Cepheid variables have been discovered in the Fornax Cluster spiral galaxy NGC 1365. The resulting V and I period-luminosity relations yield a true distance modulus of 31.35 +/- 0.07 mag, which corresponds to a distance of 18.6 +/- 0.6 Mpc. This measurement provides several routes for estimating the Hubble Constant. (1) Assuming this distance for the Fornax Cluster as a whole yields a local Hubble Constant of 70 +/-18_{random} [+/-7]_{systematic} km/s/Mpc. (2) Nine Cepheid-based distances to groups of galaxies out to and including the Fornax and Virgo clusters yield Ho = 73 (+/-16)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/Mpc. (3) Recalibrating the I-band Tully-Fisher relation using NGC 1365 and six nearby spiral galaxies, and applying it to 15 galaxy clusters out to 100 Mpc gives Ho = 76 (+/-3)_r [+/-8]_s km/s/Mpc. (4) Using a broad-based set of differential cluster distance moduli ranging from Fornax to Abell 2147 gives Ho = 72 (+/-)_r [+/-6]_s km/s/Mpc. And finally, (5) Assuming the NGC 1365 distance for the two additional Type Ia supernovae in Fornax and adding them to the SnIa calibration (correcting for light curve shape) gives Ho = 67 (+/-6)_r [+/-7]_s km/s/Mpc out to a distance in excess of 500 Mpc. All five of these Ho determinations agree to within their statistical errors. The resulting estimate of the Hubble Constant combining all these determinations is Ho = 72 (+/-5)_r [+/-12]_s km/s/Mpc.	0	10	8
cs/9812013	The Self-Organizing Symbiotic Agent	In [N. A. Baas, Emergence, Hierarchies, and Hyper-structures, in C.G. Langton ed., Artificial Life III, Addison Wesley, 1994.] a general framework for the study of Emergence and hyper-structure was presented. This approach is mostly concerned with the description of such systems. In this paper we will try to bring forth a different aspect of this model we feel will be useful in the engineering of agent based solutions, namely the symbiotic approach. In this approach a self-organizing method of dividing the more complex "main-problem" to a hyper-structure of "sub-problems" with the aim of reducing complexity is desired. A description of the general problem will be given along with some instances of related work. This paper is intended to serve as an introductory challenge for general solutions to the described problem.	0	0	0
cond-mat/9812251	U(1)XSU(2) Gauge theory of underdoped high Tc cuprates via Chern-Simons bosonization	We outline the basic ideas involved in a recently proposed derivation of a gauge theory for underdoped cuprates in the "spin-gap phase", performed essentially step by step starting from the t-J model, considered as a model Hamiltonian for the CuO_2 layers. The basic tool is the U(1)XSU(2) Chern-Simons bosonization, to which it is dedicated a somewhat detailed discussion. The basic output is a "spin-gap" not vanishing in any direction and an antiferromagnetic correlation length proportional to the inverse square root of doping concentration, in agreement with data deduced from the neutron experiments. The model also exhibits a small half-pocket Fermi surface around (\pi/2, \pi/2) and a linear in temperature dependence of in-plane resistivity in certain temperature range.	1	2	2

astro-ph/9904150	A possible explanation for the anomalous acceleration of Pioneer 10	The reported anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 spacecraft of -8.5X10^{-10} m/s^2 (i.e. towards the sun) can be explained by a gravitational interaction on the S-band signals traveling between Pioneer 10 and the earth. The effect of this gravitational interaction is a frequency shift that is proportional to the distance and the square root of the density of the medium in which it travels. If changes in this frequency are interpreted as a Doppler shift the result is an apparent acceleration directed towards the sun. The gravitational interaction is caused by the focusing of the signal photons in curved space where in this case the curvature is related by the density of the interplanetary dust.	0	5	0
astro-ph/9904327	The Properties of Field Elliptical Galaxies at Intermediate Redshift. I: Empirical Scaling Laws	We present measurements of the Fundamental Plane (FP) parameters (the effective radius, the mean effective surface brightness, and the central velocity dispersion) of six field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift. The imaging is taken from the Medium Deep Survey of the Hubble Space Telescope, while the kinematical data are obtained from long-slit spectroscopy using the 3.6-m ESO telescope. The Fundamental Plane appears well defined in the field even at redshift $\approx$ 0.3. The data show a shift in the FP zero point with respect to the local relation, possibly indicating modest evolution, consistent with the result found for intermediate redshift cluster samples. The FP slopes derived for our field data, plus other cluster ellipticals at intermediate redshift taken from the literature, differ from the local ones, but are still consistent with the interpretation of the FP as a result of homology, of the virial theorem and of the existence of a relation between luminosity and mass, $L \propto M^{\eta}$. We also derive the surface brightness vs. effective radius relation for nine galaxies with redshift up to $z \approx0.6$, and data from the literature; the evolution that can be inferred is consistent with what is found using the FP.	0	98	96
astro-ph/9904421	Polarimetric Properties of the Crab Pulsar between 1.4 and 8.4 GHz	New polarimetric observations of the Crab pulsar at frequencies between 1.4 and 8.4 GHz are presented. Additional pulse components discovered in earlier observations (Moffett & Hankins 1996, astro-ph/9604163) are found to have high levels of linear polarization, even at 8.4 GHz. No abrupt sweeps in position angle are found within pulse components; however, the position angle and rotational phase of the interpulse do change dramatically between 1.4 and 4.9 GHz. The multi-frequency profile morphology and polarization properties indicate a non-standard origin of the emission. Several emission geometries are discussed, but the one favored locates sites of emission both near the pulsar surface and in the outer magnetosphere.	0	2	2
cond-mat/9904112	Persistent currents on graphs	We develop a method to calculate the persistent currents and their spatial distribution (and transport properties) on graphs made of quasi-1D diffusive wires. They are directly related to the field derivatives of the determinant of a matrix which describes the topology of the graph. In certain limits, they are obtained by simple counting of the nodes and their connectivity. We relate the average current of a disordered graph with interactions and the non-interacting current of the same graph with clean 1D wires. A similar relation exists for orbital magnetism in general.	1	0	0

In the integrable case, irrelevant perturbations are shown to multiply reflection matrices by CDD factors: the low-energy behavior is not changed, while various high-energy behaviors are possible, including ``roaming'' RG trajectories. In the non-integrable case, a Monte Carlo study shows that the IR behavior is again generically unchanged, provided scaling variables are appropriately renormalized.	1	1	0

In particular we demonstrate that it yields quantities which are approximately tensorial in these situations, and that its application to an exact FLRW metric yields another FLRW metric, to first-order in integrals over the local coordinates. Finally, we indicate some important limits of any linearized averaging procedure with respect to cosmological perturbations which are the result of averages over large amplitude small and intermediate scale inhomogeneities, and show our averaging procedure can be approximately implemented by that of Zotov and Stoeger in these cases.	0	19	10
gr-qc/9904031	Super-energy tensor for space-times with vanishing scalar curvature	A four-index tensor is constructed with terms both quadratic in the Riemann tensor and linear in its second derivatives, which has zero divergence for space-times with vanishing scalar curvature. This tensor reduces in vacuum to the Bel-Robinson tensor. Furthermore, the completely timelike component referred to any observer is positive, and zero if and only if the space-time is flat (excluding some unphysical space-times). We also show that this tensor is the unique that can be constructed with these properties. Such a tensor does not exist for general gravitational fields. Finally, we study this tensor in several examples: the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker space-times filled with radiation, the plane-fronted gravitational waves, and the Vaidya radiating metric.	0	3	2
hep-ph/9904214	Dispersion Relations and Rescattering Effects in B Nonleptonic Decays	Recently, the final state strong interactions in nonleptonic B decays were investigated in a formalism based on hadronic unitarity and dispersion relations in terms of the off-shell mass squared of the $B$ meson. We consider an heuristic derivation of the dispersion relations in the mass variables using the reduction LSZ formalism and find a discrepancy between the spectral function and the dispersive variable used in the recent works. The part of the unitarity sum which describes final state interactions is shown to appear as spectral function in a dispersion relation based on the analytic continuation in the mass squared of one final particles. As an application, by combining this formalism with Regge theory and SU(3) flavour symmetry we obtain constraints on the tree and the penguin amplitudes of the decay $B^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$.	0	9	8
math/9904055	Operads and Motives in Deformation Quantization	This paper is dedicated to the memory of Moshe Flato, and will appear in Lett. Math. Phys. 48 (1) It became clear during last 5-6 years that the algebraic world of associative algebras (abelian categories, triangulated categories, etc) has many deep connections with the geometric world of two-dimensional surfaces. One of manifestations of this is Deligne's conjecture (1993) which says that on the cohomological Hochschild complex of any associative algebra naturally acts the operad of singular chains in the little discs operad. Recently D. Tamarkin discovered that the operad of chains of the little discs operad is formal, i.e. it is homotopy equivalent to its cohomology. From this fact and from Deligne's conjecture follows almost immediately my formality result in deformation quantization. I review the situation as it looks now. Also I conjecture that the motivic Galois group acts on deformation quantizations, and speculate on possible relations of higher-dimensional algebras and of motives to quantum field theories.	0	219	57

The $\tau$-Conjecture for polynomials implies that $\mathcal{UP}$ does not contain the class of non-deterministic polynomial time problems definable without constants over $\mathbb C$. This latest statement implies that $\mathcal P \ne \mathcal{NP}$ over $\mathbb C$. A notion of `ultimate complexity' of a problem is suggested. It provides lower bounds for the complexity of structured problems.	0	0	0

While the a -term provides a tiny contribution the b - and d -terms provides a tiny contribution the b - and d -terms are important to gain the experimental binding energy. We find two solutions for the c -term, one around the value used in the Tucson-Melbourne model and a new one close to zero, which supports the recentrecommendation of chiral perturbation theory that the short-range c -term should be dropped.	0	3	3
nucl-th/9904065	Nuclear Physics of Double Beta Decay	Study of the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay allows us to put a stringent limit on the effective neutrino Majorana mass, a quantity of fundamental importance. To test our ability to evaluate the nuclear matrix elements that govern the decay rate, it is desirable to be able to describe the allowed two-neutrino decay. It is argued that only low-lying virtual intermediate states are important for that process, and thus it appears that the large-scale shell model evaluation, free from the various difficulties of QRPA, is the preferred method. In the $0\nu$ decay, it is shown that there is a substantial cancellation between the paired and broken pair pieces of the nuclear wave function. Thus, despite the popular claim to the contrary, one expects that the $0\nu$ rate is also sensitive to the details of nuclear structure. This is reflected in the spread of the theoretical values, leading to the uncertainty of about factor 2-3 in the deduced $<m_{\nu}>$ limit. Finally, brief comment about the $0\nu$ decay with the exchange of a very heavy neutrino are made.	0	4	1
patt-sol/9904004	Optical Vortex Solitons in Parametric Wave Mixing	We analyze two-component spatial optical vortex solitons supported by parametric wave mixing processes in a nonlinear bulk medium. We study two distinct cases of such localised waves, namely, parametric vortex solitons due to phase-matched second-harmonic generation in an optical medium with competing quadratic and cubic nonlinear response, and vortex solitons in the presence of third-harmonic generation in a cubic medium. We find, analytically and numerically, the structure of two-component vortex solitons, and also investigate modulational instability of their plane-wave background. In particular, we predict and analyze in detail novel types of vortex solitons, a `halo-vortex', consisting of a two-component vortex core surrounded by a bright ring of its harmonic field, and a `ring-vortex' soliton which is a vortex in a harmonic field that guides a ring-like localized mode of the fundamental-frequency field.	0	1	0

In this paper, we extend that construction to more general theories which do not refer to any background, space-time metric (and in which the space of histories does not admit a natural linear structure). Examples include certain gauge theories, topological field theories and relativistic gravitational theories. The treatment is self-contained in the sense that an a priori knowledge of the Osterwalder-Schrader theorem is not assumed.	0	21	0
astro-ph/9903023	A Possible Explanation for the Radio ``Flare'' in the Early Afterglow of GRB990123	We suggest that the deceleration of the relativistic shock by a denser part of the interstellar medium off line-of-sight produced the observed radio ``flare'' in the early afterglow of GRB990123. We find that this scenario is consistent with observations if the particle number density of this denser part of the medium is between $\sim 200$ and $\sim 2\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$. Because of the premature deceleration of part of the shock, the later stage of the afterglow should decay modestly faster than the powerlaw expected from an isotropic shock propagation.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9903099	X-ray Observations of TeV Blazars and Multi-Frequency Analysis	The non-thermal spectra of blazars, observed from radio to GeV/TeV gamma-rays, reveal two pronounced components, both produced by radiation by energetic particles. One peaks in the IR - to soft X-ray band, radiating via the synchrotron process; the other, peaking in the high-energy gamma-rays, is produced by the Compton process. These spectra -- and, in particular, the \asca data -- suggest that the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization is diverse. In the High-energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs), the dominant seed photons for Comptonization appear to be the synchrotron photons internal to the jet (SSC process). In the quasar-hosted blazars (QHBs), on the other hand, the X-ray band emission is still dominated by the SSC process, while the MeV to GeV range is produced by Comptonization of external photons such as the emission line light. In the context of this three-component model, we derive the magnetic field of 0.1 - 1 Gauss for all classes of blazars. Lorentz factors gamma_{peak} of electrons radiating at each peak of the nuFnu spectra are estimated to be ~10^{5}$ for HBLs; this is much higher than ~10^{3}$ for QHBs. This difference is consistent with the fact that the four sources that are known to emit TeV gamma-rays (TeV blazars) are all classified as HBLs. Among the TeV blazars, Mkn 421 is one of the brightest and most variable emitters from ultraviolet (eV) to hard gamma-ray (TeV) energies.The multi-frequency observations including TeV energy band provide the best opportunity to understand high-energy emission from blazar jets. In this paper, we discuss results of multi-frequency analysis and review the results of intensive campaigns for Mkn 421 from 1994 to 1998	0	20	20
astro-ph/9903101	Pulsar rotation measures and the magnetic structure of our Galaxy	We have obtained 63 rotation measures (RMs) from polarization observations of southern pulsars, of which 54 are new measurements and 3 are varied from previous values. The new pulsar RM data at high Galactic latitudes are mostly consistent with the antisymmetric RM distribution found previously. For the Galactic disc, evidence for a field reversal near the Perseus arm, and possibly another beyond it, is presented. Inside the Solar Circle, in addition to the two known field reversals in or near the Carina-Sagittartus arm and the Crux-Scutum arm, a further reversal in the Norma arm is tentatively identified. These reversals, together with the pitch angle derived from pulsar RM and stellar polarization distributions, are consistent with bisymmetric spiral (BSS) models for the large-scale magnetic field structure in the disc of our Galaxy. However, discrimination between models is complicated by the presence of smaller-scale irregularities in the magnetic field, as well as uncertainties in the theoretical modelling.	0	6	6
astro-ph/9903205	The Fourth BATSE Gamma-Ray Burst Catalog (Revised)	The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) has triggered on 1637 cosmic gamma-ray bursts between 1991 April 19 and 1996 August 29. These events constitute the Fourth BATSE burst catalog. The current version (4Br) has been revised from the version first circulated on CD-ROM in September 1997 (4B) to include improved locations for a subset of bursts that have been reprocssed using additional data. A significant difference from previous BATSE catalogs is the inclusion of bursts from periods when the trigger energy range differed from the nominal 50-300 keV. We present tables of the burst occurrence times, locations, peak fluxes, fluences, and durations. In general, results from previous BATSE catalogs are confirmed here with greater statistical significance.	0	237	231
astro-ph/9903411	The reheating and reionization history of the universe	We incorporate quasars into an analytic model to describe the reheating and reionization of the universe. In combination with a previous study of galaxies and Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds, we are able to provide a unified description of structure formation, verified against a large variety of observations. We also take into account the clumping of the baryonic gas in addition to the presence of collapsed objects. We consider two cosmologies: a critical universe with a CDM power-spectrum and an open universe with $\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda=0$. The derived quasar luminosity function agrees reasonably well with observations at $z<4.5$ and with constraints over larger redshifts from the HDF. The radiation produced by these objects at $z \sim 16$ slowly reheats the universe which gets suddenly reionized at $z_{ri}=6.8$ for the open universe ($z_{ri}=5.6$ for the critical density universe). The UV background radiation simultaneously increases sharply to reach a maximum of $J_{21} = 0.18$ at $z=2.6$, but shows strong ionization edges until $z \leq 1$. The metallicity of the gas increases quickly at high $z$ and is already larger than $0.01 Z_{\odot}$ at $z=10$. The QSO number counts and the helium opacity constrain the reionization redshift to be $z_{ri} \sim 6$. We confirm that a population of faint quasars is needed in order to satisfy the observations. Due to the low reionization redshift, the damping of CMB fluctuations is quite small, but future observations (e.g. with the NGST) of the multiplicity functions of radiation sources and of the HI and HeII opacities will strongly constrain scenarios in which reionization is due to QSOs.	0	82	82

Collections of Fourier amplitudes are represented by nonuniformly spaced modes with enhanced coupling coefficients. The statistics of the full dynamics can be recovered from the time-averaged predictions of the reduced model. A Liouville theorem leads to inviscid equipartition solutions. Excellent agreement is obtained with two-dimensional forced-dissipative pseudospectral simulations.

Explicit formulas for the energy levels and wavefunctions are found. There are localized states, never before noticed in this well studied problem, whose localization is due to phase interference, even though there is no or negligible classical effect of the magnetic field. These and related states account almost entirely for the magnetic response in certain temperature ranges, and thus have a bearing on the experiments of Levy et al.	1	1	0

In the third and higher Landau levels, at filling fractions nu=9/2, 11/2, etc., the in-plane field can lead to a striking interchange of the "hard" and "easy" transport directions. In the second Landau level the normally isotropic resistivity and the weak nu=5/2 quantized Hall state are destroyed by a large in-plane field and the transport becomes highly anisotropic.	1	19	10

The energy-momentum dispersions of charge and spin excitation obtained from Raman cross-section show the characteristc cross-over behaviour induced by inter-edge Coulomb interaction. The "SPE" peak near resonance in polarized spectra becomes broad due to the momentum dependence of charge velocity. The broad peak in the depolarized spectra is shown to originate from the disparity between charge and spin excitation velocity.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9903388	Transverse-field Ising spin chain with inhomogeneous disorder	We consider the critical and off-critical properties at the boundary of the random transverse-field Ising spin chain when the distribution of the couplings and/or transverse fields, at a distance $l$ from the surface, deviates from its uniform bulk value by terms of order $l^{-\kappa}$ with an amplitude $A$. Exact results are obtained using a correspondence between the surface magnetization of the model and the surviving probability of a random walk with time-dependent absorbing boundary conditions. For slow enough decay, $\kappa<1/2$, the inhomogeneity is relevant: Either the surface stays ordered at the bulk critical point or the average surface magnetization displays an essential singularity, depending on the sign of $A$. In the marginal situation, $\kappa=1/2$, the average surface magnetization decays as a power law with a continuously varying, $A$-dependent, critical exponent which is obtained analytically. The behavior of the critical and off-critical autocorrelation functions as well as the scaling form of the probability distributions for the surface magnetization and the first gaps are determined through a phenomenological scaling theory. In the Griffiths phase, the properties of the Griffiths-McCoy singularities are not affected by the inhomogeneity. The various results are checked using numerical methods based on a mapping to free fermions.	1	7	4
gr-qc/9903052	Classical roots of the Unruh and Hawking effects	Although the Unruh and Hawking phenomena are commonly linked to field quantization in "accelerated" coordinates or in curved spacetimes, we argue that they are deeply rooted at the classical level. We maintain in particular that these effects should be best understood by considering how the special-relativistic notion of "particle" gets blurred when employed in theories including accelerated observers or in general-relativistic theories, and that this blurring is an instantiation of a more general behavior arising when the principle of equivalence is used to generalize classical or quantum special-relativistic theories to curved spacetimes or accelerated observers. A classical analogue of the Unruh effect, stemming from the non-invariance of the notion of "electromagnetic radiation" as seen by inertial and accelerated observers, is illustrated by means of four gedanken-experimente. The issue of energy balance in the various cases is also briefly discussed.	0	11	11

The results are based on 100 GeV pion beam data at incidence angle $\Theta = 10^o$ at impact point Z in the range from - 36 to 20 cm which were obtained during test beam period in May 1995 with setup equipped scintillator detector planes placed behind and back of the calorimeter. The fraction of the energy of 100 GeV pions at $\Theta = 10^o$ leaking out at the back of this calorimeter amounts to 1.8 % and agrees with the one for a conventional iron-scintillator calorimeter. Unexpected behaviour of the energy resolution as a function of leakage is observed: 6 % lateral leakage lead to 18 % improving of energy resolution in compare with the showers without leakage. The measured values of longitudinal punchthrough probability $(18 \pm 1) %$ and $(20 \pm 1) %$ for two different hit definitions of leaking events agree with the earlier measurement for our calorimeter and with the one for a conventional iron-scintillator calorimeter with the same nuclear interaction length thickness respectively. Due to more soft cut for hit definition in the leakage detectors the measured value of longitudinal punchthrough probability more corresponds to the calculated iron equivalent length $L_{Fe} = 158 cm$.	0	0	0

Attention is focussed on the lowest lying S and P states, and the triplet fine structure is obtained for the first time using a relativistic action.	0	9	7
hep-lat/9903033	A novel gauge invariant multi-state smearing technique	We present an investigation of a gauge invariant smearing technique that allows the construction of smearing functions with arbitrary radial behaviour, by foresaking the space filling nature of traditional smearing techniques. This is applied to both heavy-heavy, heavy-light, and light-light systems with one particular choice of radial ``wavefunction'' - the hydrogenic solutions - and we find good stability for both fitted masses and amplitudes of the radially excited states. The dependence of the amplitudes on the smearing radius is demonstrated to be well understood, while near optimal smearing radii may be found with extremely low statistics using a property of the smeared-local correlator. The smearing technique is inexpensive since it is non-iterative, achieves a good signal to noise ratio, and can be altered to use wavefunctions from, say, potential models or the Bethe-Salpether equations in future simulations.	0	20	19

We find that the corrections are large, both in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). These corrections have an important effect on the interpretation of the Tevatron data, leading to the non-existence of a model-independent bound in the tan(beta)-MH+ plane.	0	6	4
hep-ph/9903256	Nine lectures on quark structure of light hadrons	The following lectures concern with the quark structure of hadrons made up from light quarks. The symmetries of strong interaction were the only instruments used for the description of this structure. The models of hadrons (there are a lot of them) were not considered. There was not also considered the structure of hadrons with heavy quarks. The first round of problems (models of hadrons) is not considered because of its unexhaustability. The second round of problems (hadrons with heavy quarks) is not considered because of the physics of heavy flavors tends mainly to electroweak interaction and will be considered in the course of electroweak interactions. Therefore, the presented here course, being the self-bounded part of the theory of elementary particles, is considered separately. These lectures were formed from 1989 and are the part of the set of courses on the theory of fundamental interactions for the students of Moscow Physical Technical Institute. The basic source of the lectures was the unpublished manuscript "Hadrons and quarks" by L.B. Okun. Another source was the "Lectures on the theory of unitary symmetry in elementary particle physics" by Nguen Van Hieu (Atomizdat, Moscow 1967). The list of references (due to its smallness) is absent.	0	0	0

Within the parameter space, we find that: (a) the new contribution from technipions is less than 2% of the standard model prediction; (b) the top-pions can provide a factor of 10 to 30 enhancement to the ratios in question; (c) the topcolor-assisted technicolor model is consistent with the current experimental data.	0	5	5

We find that an over-all precision tag for the currently available program BHLUMI 4.04 can be reduced from 0.11% to 0.061% at LEP1 and from 0.25% to 0.122% at LEP2. For the large-angle Bhabha process, we present the Monte Carlo program BHWIDE and compare its predictions with predictions of other Monte Carlo programs as well as semi-analytical calculations.	0	16	11
hep-th/9903008	Loop corrections and graceful exit in string cosmology	We examine the effect of perturbative string loops on the cosmological pre-big-bang evolution. We study loop corrections derived from heterotic string theory compactified on a $Z_N$ orbifold and we consider the effect of the all-order loop corrections to the Kahler potential and of the corrections to gravitational couplings, including both threshold corrections and corrections due to the mixed Kahler-gravitational anomaly. We find that string loops can drive the evolution into the region of the parameter space where a graceful exit is in principle possible, and we find solutions that, in the string frame, connect smoothly the superinflationary pre-big-bang evolution to a phase where the curvature and the derivative of the dilaton are decreasing. We also find that at a critical coupling the loop corrections to the Kahler potential induce a ghost-like instability, i.e. the kinetic term of the dilaton vanishes. This is similar to what happens in Seiberg-Witten theory and signals the transition to a new regime where the light modes in the effective action are different and are related to the original ones by S-duality. In a string context, this means that we enter a D-brane dominated phase.	0	54	36
hep-th/9903049	Supersymmetry and the Yang-Mills Effective Action at Finite N	We study the effective action of quantum mechanical SU(N) Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supersymmetries and N>2. We show that supersymmetry requires that the eight fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of the $v^4$ terms be one-loop exact. We also show that the twelve fermion terms in the supersymmetric completion of the $v^6$ terms are two-loop exact for N=3. For N>3, this no longer seems to be true; we are able to find non-renormalization theorems for only certain twelve fermion structures. We call these structures `generalized F-terms.' We argue that as the rank of the gauge group is increased, there can be more generalized F-terms at higher orders in the derivative expansion.	0	30	30

The Dirac-Schwinger consistency condition is satisfied by the reduced phase space Hamiltonian density with respect to the the Dirac bracket. It is shown that relativistic invariance under boosts can be obtained only if gauge conditions were chosen consistent with the equations of motion. Moreover all gauge invariant quantities are shown to be free of transformation anomaly.	0	0	0

astro-ph/9906051	Measuring angular diameters of extended sources - I. Theory	When measuring diameters of partially resolved sources like planetary nebulae, H II regions or galaxies, often a technique called gaussian deconvolution is used. This technique yields a gaussian diameter which subsequently has to be multiplied with a conversion factor to obtain the true angular diameter of the source. This conversion factor is a function of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the beam. It also depends on the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the source. In this paper the theory behind this technique will be studied. This study will be restricted to circularly symmetric geometries and beams. First an implicit equation will be derived, from which the conversion factor for a given surface brightness distribution and beam size can be solved. Explicit expressions for the conversion factor will be derived from this equation which are valid in cases where the beam size is larger than the intrinsic size of the source. A more detailed discussion will be given for two simple geometries: a circular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical constant emissivity shell with arbitrary inner radius. The theory is subsequently used to construct a new technique for determining the FWHM of an arbitrary observed surface brightness distribution. Usually the FWHM of the source and beam are measured using gaussian fits, but second moments can also be used. The alternative use of second moments in this context is studied here for the first time and it is found that in this case the conversion factor has a different value which is independent of the beam size. In the limit for infinitely large beam sizes, the values of the conversion factors for both techniques are equal.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9906223	Efficiency of Magnetized Thin Accretion Disks in the Kerr Metric	The efficiency of thin disk accretion onto black holes depends on the inner boundary condition, specifically the torque applied to the disk at the last stable orbit. This is usually assumed to vanish. I estimate the torque on a magnetized disk using a steady magnetohydrodynamic inflow model originally developed by Takahashi et al., 1990. I find that the efficiency epsilon can depart significantly from the classical thin disk value. In some cases epsilon > 1, i.e. energy is extracted from the black hole.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9906459	The b Distribution of the Lya Forest: Probing Cosmology and the Intergalactic Medium	We investigate a method to determine the temperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z~2-4 using quasar absorption line systems. Using a simple model combined with numerical simulations we show that there is a lower cutoff in the distribution of column density (NHI) and line width (b parameter). The location of this cutoff can be used to determine the temperature-density relation (under certain conditions). We describe and test an algorithm to do this. The method works as long as the amplitude of fluctuations on these scales (~100 kpc) is sufficiently large. Models with less power can mimic higher temperatures. A preliminary application is made to data from two quasar lines-of-sight, and we determine an upper limit to the temperature of the IGM. Finally, we examine the full distribution of b-parameters and show that this is completely specified by just two parameters: the temperature of the gas and the amplitude of the power spectrum. Using the temperature upper limit measured with the NHI-b cutoff method, we derive an upper limit to the amplitude of the power spectrum.	0	8	8
astro-ph/9906488	Young Globular Clusters	Star formation in starbursts appears to be biased toward compact clusters, with up to 20% of all stars formed in them. Observations with HST show that many of these clusters have luminosities (-9 > Mv > -16), UBVI colors, and half-light radii (R_eff = ~3 pc) consistent with their being young globular clusters. Although we know little about the long-term stability of the youngest clusters (<20 Myr), compact clusters older than ~10 core-crossing times (20 - 40 Myr) are bound gravitationally and very likely young globulars. The present review concentrates on recent progress achieved in dating such clusters and on evidence that mergers of spiral galaxies can produce relatively rich subsystems of young globulars of solar metallicity in the remnants' halos. Studies of such subsystems suggest a scenario in which second-generation globulars form from giant molecular clouds squeezed into collapse by the high-pressure environment of starbursts. These bursts, often driven by mergers, may explain ongoing cluster formation in NGC 4038/39, the young halo globular clusters found around protoellipticals like NGC 3921 and NGC 7252, and the subpopulations of red metal-rich globulars observed in many giant elliptical galaxies.	0	3	3
cond-mat/9906096	Entropy, vortex interactions, and the phase diagram of heavy-ion irradiated Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8	Dynamic and thermodynamic magnetization experiments on heavy-ion irradiated single crystalline Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta} are correlated in order to clarify the nature of the mixed state phase diagram. It is shown that whereas the entropy contribution to the free energy in the London regime plays a minor role in unirradiated crystals and irradiated crystals at fields close to or above the matching field $B_{\phi}$, it becomes very important at low fields in irradiated crystals with high $B_{\phi}$. The direct determination of the entropy contribution to the free energy from the reversible magnetization allows one to determine not only the correct values of the pinning energy, but also to extract quite detailed information on pancake vortex alignment. The characteristic field $H_{int} \sim {1/6} B_{\phi}$ at which intervortex repulsion begins to determine the vortex arrangement and the reversible magnetization is shown to coincide with a sharp increase in the irreversibility field $H_{irr}(T)$ and with the recoupling transition found in Josephson Plasma Resonance. Above $H_{int}$, the repulsive interaction between vortices cause both the vortex mobility to decrease and pancake alignement to increase. At higher fields $\gtrsim {1/3}B_{\phi}\gg B_{c1}$, free vortices outnumber those that are trapped on a columnar defect. This causes the decrease of c-axis resistivity and a second crossover of the irreversibility field, to a regime where it is determined by plastic creep.	1	0	0

Using the recently developed QED theory of liquid water, we are also able to give a successful account of the surprising finding of two low-temperature water amorphs and of their phase-transition.	1	0	0

The measured depth-angular distribution of muon intensities has been used to obtain the normalization factor, A, the power index, gamma, of the primary all-nucleon spectrum and the ratio, R_c, of prompt muon flux to that of pi-mesons - the main parameters which determine the spectrum of cosmic ray muons at the sea level. The value of gamma = 2.77 +/- 0.05 (68% C.L.) and R_c < 2.0 x 10^-3 (95% C.L.) have been obtained.

Specifically, we discuss a selection of analyses related to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) parameters Vcb, Vub, alpha, and gamma, and the nonperturbative heavy quark effective theory quantities lambda_1 and lambda_bar. We first describe an examination of the first and second moments of the hadronic-recoil mass and charged-lepton energy spectra in inclusive b -> c l nu decays. We also report on the reconstruction, using similar experimental techniques, of the CKM-suppressed decay B -> rho l nu and the extraction of its branching fraction, Br(B0 -> rho- l+ nu) = (2.57 +- 0.29 +0.33/-0.46 +- 0.41) x 10E-4, as well as the value |Vub| = (3.25 +- 0.14 +0.21/-0.29 +- 0.55) x 10E-3, where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and due to model dependence, respectively. Finally, we present results on rare two-body charmless hadronic B -> K pi, pi pi, and K K decays and comment briefly on their implications to the geometry of the CKM unitarity triangle, including a bound on gamma.	0	0	0

We investigated non-perturbative power corrections for the thrust, C-parameter, total and wide jet broadening observables. We observe a good description of the distributions by the combined resummed QCD calculations plus power corrections from the dispersive approach. The single non-perturbative parameter \alpha_0 is measured to be \alpha_0 (2 GeV) = 0.502 +- 0.013 (stat.) ^{+0.046)_{-0.032} (exp. syst.) ^{+0.074}_{-0.053} (theo. syst.) and is found to be universal for the observables studied within the given systematic uncertainties. Using revised calculations of the power corrections for the jet broadening variables, improved consistency of the individual fit results is obtained. Agreement is also found with results extracted from the mean values of event shape distributions.	0	13	4

Results on two-particle angular correlations in jet cones and on multiplicity fluctuations in one- and two- dimensional angular intervals, delivered by three experiments (DELPHI, L3 and ZEUS, at $\sqrt{s}$ from few to 183 GeV) are compared to present existing analytical QCD calculations, using the LPHD hypothesis. Two different types of functions have been tested. While the differentially normalized correlation functions show substantial deviations from the predictions, a globally normalized correlation function agrees surprisingly well. The role of the QCD parameters $\alpha_s$, $\Lambda$ and $n_f$ is discussed. The necessity to include full energy-momentum conservation into the analytical calculations is stressed.	0	1	1
hep-ph/9906223	Color gauge invariance in the Drell-Yan process	We consider the color gauge invariance of a factorized description of the Drell-Yan process cross section. In particular, we focus on the next-to-leading twist contributions for polarized scattering and on the cross section differential in the transverse momentum of the lepton pair in the region where the transverse momentum is small compared to the hard scale. The hadron tensor is expressed in terms of manifestly color gauge invariant, nonlocal operator matrix elements and a color gauge invariant treatment of soft gluon poles is given. Also, we clarify the discrepancy between two published results for a single spin asymmetry in the Drell-Yan cross section. This asymmetry arises if such a soft gluon pole is present in a specific twist-three hadronic matrix element.	0	56	48
hep-ph/9906291	The Soft Gluon Emission Process in the Color-Octet Model for Heavy Quarkonium Production	The Color-Octet Model has been used successfully to analyze many problems in heavy quarkonium production. We examine some of the conceptual and practical problems of the soft gluon emission process in the Color-Octet Model. We use a potential model to describe the initial and final states in the soft gluon emission process, as the emission occurs at a late stage after the production of the heavy quark pair. It is found in this model that the soft gluon M1 transition, 1S0(8)->3S1(1), dominates over the E1 transition, 3PJ(8)->3S1(1), for J/psi and psi' production. Such a dominance may help resolve the questions of isotropic polarization and color-octet matrix element universality in the Color-Octet Model.	0	19	10
hep-ph/9906331	Assisted Chaotic Inflation in Higher Dimensional Theories	We address the problem of the large initial field values in chaotic inflation and propose a remedy in the framework of the so-called assisted inflation. We demonstrate that a 4-dimensional theory of multiple, scalar fields with initial field values considerably below the Planck scale, can give rise to inflation even though none of the individual scalar fields are capable of driving inflation. The problems arising from the presence of possible non-renormalizable interactions is therefore removed. As a concrete example of a theory with multiple scalar fields, we consider a (4+d)-dimensional field theory of a single, non-interacting massive scalar field whose KK modes play the role of the assisted sector. For the KK modes to assist inflation, the extra dimensions must have a size larger than the inverse (4D) Planck scale.	0	109	34

A more detailed analysis of QCD predictions, including information on quark and gluon condensates, requires more precise data on $e^+e^-\to{hadrons}$, particularly in the region $E<M_{J/\Psi}$ and $M_{J/\Psi}<E<3.6 GeV$. use of experimental determination of the D-function to test the generalized Crewther relation is outlined.	0	7	7
nucl-th/9906007	Semi-Microscopical Description of the Scission Configuration in the Cold Fission of $^{252}$Cf	The cold(neutronless) fission of $^{252}$Cf is studied in the frame of a molecular model in which the scission configuration is described by two aligned fragments interacting by means of Coulomb (+ nuclear) forces. The study is carried out for different distances between the fragments tips and excitation energies. For a given deformation, the fragment's total energy is computed via the constrained Hartree-Fock + BCS formalism. The total excitation energy present in the fragments is supposed to contribute only to the fragments deformation and the asymptotic value of the kinetic energy is equated to the inter-fragment potential at scission. These two constraints yield not more than one or two fission channels for a fixed tip distance and excitation energy. Discarding those fission channels corresponding to a disequilibrated sharing of the excitation energy between the two fragments, we were able to establish the most likely scission configurations for a specified excitation energy.	0	0	0

The entanglement between states of measured system and "pointer" states of measuring apparatus, which is generated by dynamical process of quantum measurement, plays a dominant role in expressing quantum characteristics of information theory. The quantum mutual information of transmission and reception of quantum states along a noisy quantum channel is given by the change of quantum measured information. In our approach, it is not necessary to purify the transmitted state by means of the reference system. It is also clarified that there exist relations between the approach given in this letter and those given by other authors.	0	1	1

quant-ph/9906123	Disentangling Nonlocality and Teleportation	Quantum entanglement can be used to demonstrate nonlocality and to teleport a quantum state from one place to another. The fact that entanglement can be used to do both these things has led people to believe that teleportation is a nonlocal effect. In this paper it is shown that teleportation is conceptually independent of nonlocality. This is done by constructing a toy local theory in which cloning is not possible (without a no-cloning theory teleportation makes limited sense) but teleportation is. Teleportation in this local theory is achieved in an analogous way to the way it is done with quantum theory. This work provides some insight into what type of process teleportation is.	0	29	29
astro-ph/9909346	The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Investigating the Influence of Blending on the Cepheid Distance Scale with Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud	We investigate the influence of blending on the Cepheid distance scale. Blending leads to systematically low distances to galaxies observed with HST, and therefore to systematically high estimates of the Hubble constant H_0. We select a sample of 43 long-period, large-amplitude Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, from the catalog recently released by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We then model the effects of blending, as observed by HST at large distances, by adding the V,I-bands contributions from nearby bright stars. We find that the derived distance modulus would be too short, compared to the true value, by ~0.07 mag at distance of 12.5 Mpc and by \~0.35 mag at distance of 25 Mpc. This has direct and important implications for the Cepheid distances to galaxies observed by the HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale and other teams: half of the KP sample is likely to exhibit a blending bias greater than 0.1 mag.	0	29	29
astro-ph/9909358	Determination of the transverse velocity of Q2237+0305	The largest systematic uncertainty present in the analysis of gravitationally microlensed quasar light curves is that of the galactic transverse velocity. We describe a method for determining the transverse velocity as well as its application to published monitoring data of Q2237+0305 (Irwin et al. 1989; Corrigan et al. 1991; Ostensen et al 1995). We find that while this data displays strong evidence for microlensing, it limits the transverse velocity to be < 500 km/sec (for microlens masses of 0.5 solar masses). In addition, by combining these results with a new method for modelling the microlensing contribution of stellar proper motions, we find that the masses of microlenses in Q2237+0305 are consistent with those of low mass stars.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9909385	First Results from the Shellflow Survey	We present preliminary results from the Shellflow program, an all-sky Tully-Fisher (TF) survey of 297 Sb-Sc with redshifts between 4000 and 7500 km/s. The program was designed to ensure uniformity of the data between observing runs and between telescopes, thereby eliminating the possibility of a spurious bulk flow caused by data inhomogeneity. A simple bulk flow model suggests that the Shellflow galaxies are nearly at rest with respect to the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Taken at face value, this result suggests that most of the ~600 km/s motion of the Local Group with respect to the CMB is due to material within ~60 Mpc/h -- a striking confirmation of the gravitational instability picture and the notion of homogeneity in the Universe. Differences between our Shellflow ``null'' result and claims of larger bulk motions based on analyses of the MarkIII catalog are possibly due to small inhomogeneities between the sub-samples in MarkIII. Our preliminary Shellflow bulk velocity, V_bulk = 80+/-150 km/s in the CMB frame, must still be refined with Monte-Carlo simulations and tidal field analysis.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9909442	Disks with Jet, ADAF, or EDAF for Sgr A*	We investigate various models of accretion disks for Sgr A*, one of the most puzzling sources in the Galaxy. The generic image we have taken into account consists of a black hole, an accretion disk, and a jet. Various accretion models are able to explain the low NIR flux of Sgr A*: a standard accretion disk with a jet, an ADAF, or an EDAF (Ejection Dominated Accretion Flow) model. We find that all of these models are conceptually similar. The accretion model which allows the formation of the jet at the innermost edge of the disk requires a sub-keplerian gas motion and a very large base of the jet. The large base of the jet may be unrealistic for Sgr A*, since the jet model and the observations suggest that the jet is collimated and anchored in the disk in a very narrow region of the disk close to the black hole. Alternatively, one can think of a jet plus wind model (EDAF), where most of the energy goes out without being dissipated in the disk. The model resembles the ADAF model at small radii. At large radii the energy is ejected by a wind.	0	1	1

It has been shown that the leading order quantum noise described in terms of an auxiliary Hamiltonian manifests itself as an additional fluctuational degree of freedom which may induce chaotic and regular oscillations in a nonlinear oscillator.	0	4	0

The distribution of strain energy for the knotted chains has a well-defined shape that is very different from the one found in the linear case. The presence of a knot significantly weakens the chain in which it is tied. Chain rupture invariably occurs just outside the entrance to the knot, as is the case for a macroscopic rope.	1	0	0

It is demonstrated that this gas solidifies always, by a mechanism which is the quantum analogue of the entropic interactions known from soft condensed matter physics.	1	1	0

It is shown that the integer quantum Hall effect transitions, the Hall insulating transition and the re-entrant transition into an insulating phase near filling factor 3/2 are all very similar and good examples of quantum critical phase transitions. The B=0 metal insulator transition also shows many similarities to these transitions but requires the inclusion of an extra impurity scattering term to fully explain the data.	1	3	1
cond-mat/9909303	Pauli and orbital effects of magnetic field on charge density waves	Taking into account both Pauli and orbital effects of external magnetic field we compute the mean field phase diagram for charge density waves in quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems. The magnetic field can cause transitions to CDW states with two types of the shifts of wave vector from its zero-field value. It can also stabilize the field-induced charge density wave. Furthermore, the critical temperature shows peaks at a new kind of magic angles.	1	2	2
cond-mat/9909344	Bose-Einstein condensation in quasi2D trapped gases	We discuss BEC in (quasi)2D trapped gases and find that well below the transition temperature $T_c$ the equilibrium state is a true condensate, whereas at intermediate temperatures $T<T_c$ one has a quasicondensate (condensate with fluctuating phase). The mean-field interaction in a quasi2D gas is sensitive to the frequency $\omega_0$ of the (tight) confinement in the "frozen" direction, and one can switch the sign of the interaction by changing $\omega_0$. Variation of $\omega_0$ can also reduce the rates of inelastic processes, which opens prospects for tunable BEC in trapped quasi2D gases.	1	59	0

The data were collected at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 189$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of $176.4 \mathrm{pb^{-1}}$. Differential cross sections of the process $\mathrm{e^+e^- \to D^{*\pm} X}$ are determined as functions of the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the $\mathrm{D^{*\pm}}$ mesons in the kinematic region 1 GeV $< p_{T}^{\mathrm{D^*}} < 5 $ GeV and $\mathrm{|\eta^{D^*}|} < 1.4$. The cross section integrated over this phase space domain is measured to be $132 \pm 22(stat.) \pm 26(syst.)$ pb.

It is transformed exactly into a lattice string model. Since the monopole interactions are weak in the infrared SU(2) QCD, the string interactions become strong. The strong coupling expansion of string model shows the quantum fluctuation is small. The classical string tension is estimated analytically, and we see it is very close to the quantum one in the SU(2) QCD. We also discuss how to calculate the glueball mass in our model.	0	1	0

These functional forms reproduce the leading non-analytic behavior of chiral perturbation theory, the correct heavy-quark limit and have the advantage of containing information on the extended structure of hadrons. The forms involve only three unknown parameters which may be optimized by fitting to present lattice data. Recent dynamical fermion results from CP-PACS and UK-QCD are extrapolated using these new functional forms. We also use these functions to probe the limit of the chiral perturbative regime and shed light on the applicability of chiral perturbation theory to the extrapolation of present lattice QCD results.	0	5	4

The Metropolis technique reveals itself very suitable for the treatment of high energy processes in particle physics, particularly when the number of final state objects and of kinematic constraints on the latter gets larger. We compare the performances of the Metropolis algorithm with those of other programs widely used in numerical simulations.	0	15	14
hep-ph/9909424	Mass and CKM Matrices of Quarks and Leptons, the Leptonic CP-phase in neutrino oscillations	A general approach for construction of quark and lepton mass matrices is formulated. The hierarchy of quarks and charged leptons ("electrons") is large, it leads using the experimental values of mixing angles to the hierarchical mass matrix slightly deviating from one's suggested earlier by Stech and including naturally the CP-phase. The same method based on the rotation of generation numbers in the diagonal mass matrix is used in the electron-neutrino sector of theory, where neutrino mass matrix is determined by the Majorano see-saw approach. The hierarchy of neutrino masses, much smaller than for quarks, was used including all existing (even preliminary) experimental data on neutrinos mixing. The leptonic mass matrix found in this way includes not known value of the leptonic CP-phase. It leads to a large $\nu_\mu \nu_\tau$ oscillations and suppresses the $\nu_e\nu_\tau$ and also $\nu_e \nu_\mu$ oscillations. The explicit expressions for the probabilities of neutrino oscillation were obtained in order to specify the role of leptonic CP-phase. The value of time reversal effect (proportional to $\sin\delta'$) was found to be small $\sim 1%$. However, a dependence of the values of $\nu_e \nu_\mu, \nu_e \nu_\tau$ transition probabilities, averaged over oscillations, on the leptonic CP-phase has found to be not small - of order of tens percent.	0	1	1
hep-ph/9909500	QED Effective Action at Finite Temperature: Two-Loop Dominance	We calculate the two-loop effective action of QED for arbitrary constant electromagnetic fields at finite temperature T in the limit of T much smaller than the electron mass. It is shown that in this regime the two-loop contribution always exceeds the influence of the one-loop part due to the thermal excitation of the internal photon. As an application, we study light propagation and photon splitting in the presence of a magnetic background field at low temperature. We furthermore discover a thermally induced contribution to pair production in electric fields.	0	44	22
hep-ph/9909503	Top quark decays into neutral Higgs bosons and gluon in the MSSM	Flavour changing neutral decays of the top quark are know to be extremely suppressed in the SM. This is especially so for the top quark decay into the SM Higgs boson, whose rate is less than 10^-13. However, it turns out that the decay modes t->c h, with h= h^0,H^0,A^0 any of the MSSM neutral Higgs bosons, can be much more gifted. In particular, the rate into the lightest CP-even Higgs boson h^0 -- which is an accessible decay mode across the whole MSSM parameter space -- is generally higher than the decay into glue, t->c g, even though the latter can also be considerably augmented in the MSSM. Our general conclusion is that the Higgs channel t->c h^0 can be the ``gold-plated'' top quark FCNC decay mode in the MSSM with rates that can reach 10^-4, i.e. already at the visible level for both LHC and LC.	0	9	9

hep-th/9909013	Wilson Loops as Precursors	There is substantial evidence that string theory on AdS_5 x S_5 is a holographic theory in which the number of degrees of freedom scales as the area of the boundary in Planck units. Precisely how the theory can describe bulk physics using only surface degrees of freedom is not well understood. A particularly paradoxical situation involves an event deep in the interior of the bulk space. The event must be recorded in the (Schroedinger Picture) state vector of the boundary theory long before a signal, such as a gravitational wave, can propagate from the event to the boundary. In a previous paper with Polchinski, we argued that the "precursor" operators which carry information stored in the wave during the time when it vanishes in a neighborhood of the boundary are necessarily non-local. In this paper we argue that the precursors cannot be products of local gauge invariant operators such as the energy momentum tensor. In fact gauge theories have a class of intrinsically non-local operators which cannot be built from local gauge invariant objects. These are the Wilson loops. We show that the precursors can be identified with Wilson loops whose spatial size is dictated by the UV-IR connection.	0	37	34

Simultaneous measurement of four noncommuting spin components is shown to lead to a chaotic jump on quantum spin sphere and to generate specific fractal images - nonlinear ifs (iterated function system). The model is purely theoretical at this stage, and experimental confirmation of the chaotic behavior of measuring instruments during simultaneous continuous measurement of several noncommuting quantum observables would constitute a quantitative verification of Event Enhanced Quantum Theory.	0	3	2

astro-ph/9901111	The Error Distribution of BATSE GRB Locations	Empirical probability models for BATSE GRB location errors are developed via a Bayesian analysis of the separations between BATSE GRB locations and locations obtained with the InterPlanetary Network (IPN). Models are compared and their parameters estimated using 392 GRBs with single IPN annuli and 19 GRBs with intersecting IPN annuli. Most of the analysis is for the 4Br BATSE catalog; earlier catalogs are also analyzed. The simplest model that provides a good representation of the error distribution has 78% of the probability in a `core' term with a systematic error of 1.85 degrees and the remainder in an extended tail with a systematic error of 5.1 degrees, implying a 68% confidence radius for bursts with negligible statistical uncertainties of 2.2 degrees. There is evidence for a more complicated model in which the error distribution depends on the BATSE datatype that was used to obtain the location. Bright bursts are typically located using the CONT datatype, and according to the more complicated model, the 68% confidence radius for CONT-located bursts with negligible statistical uncertainties is 2.0 degrees.	0	4	4

It has made substantial contributions pertaining to compact objects and their environs. Broad-band spectral and short-time-scale temporal studies are exploring the effects of General Relativity in the regime of strong gravity. We present a brief outline of the principal contributions and then give a general overview of two new areas of x-ray astronomy that have proven by RXTE to be very fruitful: accreting neutron stars with millisecond spin periods and microquasars. The former pertains to the spin evolution of low-mass x-ray binaries and the equations of state of neutron stars while the latter is lends insight to disk-jet interactions in galactic black-hole binary systems.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9901220	The Gravitational-Wave contribution to the CMB anisotropies	We study the possible contribution of a stochastic gravitational wave background to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in cold and mixed dark matter (CDM and MDM) models. We test this contribution against recent detections of CMB anisotropy at large and intermediate angular scales. Our likelihood analysis indicates that models with blue power spectra ($n \simeq 1.2$) and a tensor to the scalar quadrupole ratio of $R = C_2^T /C_2^S \sim 2$ are most consistent with the anisotropy data considered here. We find that by including the possibility of such background in CMB data analysis it can drastically alter the conclusion on the remaining cosmological parameters.	0	22	15
chao-dyn/9901023	Note on Forced Burgers Turbulence	A putative powerlaw range of the probability density of velocity gradient in high-Reynolds-number forced Burgers turbulence is studied. In the absence of information about shock locations, elementary conservation and stationarity relations imply that the exponent $-\alpha$ in this range satisfies $\alpha\ge3$, if dissipation within the powerlaw range is due to isolated shocks. A generalized model of shock birth and growth implies $\alpha=7/2$ if initial data and forcing are spatially homogeneous and obey Gaussian statistics. Arbitrary values $\alpha\ge3$ can be realized by suitably constructed homogeneous, non-Gaussian initial data and forcing.	0	11	6

Using a mean-field approximation to deal with the inter-chain magnetic coupling, the intra-chain correlations are treated exactly by numerical techniques. The magnetic coupling between impurities is computed for both adiabatic and dynamical lattices and is shown to have an alternating sign as a function of the impurity-impurity distance, hence suppressing magnetic frustration. An effective model based on our numerical results supports the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and dimerization in this system.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9901297	Pseudogaps and Extrinsic Losses in Photoemission Experiments on Poorly Conducting Solids	It is shown that a photoelectron, on being emitted from a conducting solid, suffers a substantial energy change due to ohmic losses. Almost all of this energy loss takes place after the electron leaves the solid. These losses may be important in isotropic materials with relatively low conductivity, such as certain colossal magnetoresistance manganates, and in very electrically anisotropic materials such as high-T_c superconductors and 1-D conductors. In these materials, the electric field of the photoelectron can penetrate the system. These losses can drastically affect the observed lineshape on the meV scale which is now observable due to improved resolution. In particular, extrinsic losses of this type can mimic pseudogap effects and other peculiar features of photoemission in cubic manganates. This general point is illustrated with the particular case of La_{0.67}Ca_{0.33}MnO_3.	1	1	1
cond-mat/9901341	Experimental determination of B-T phase diagram of YBa_2Cu_3O_7-d to 150T for B perpendicular to c	The B-T phase diagram for thin film YBa_2Cu_3O_7-d with B parallel to the superconducting layers has been constructed from GHz transport measurements to 150T. Evidence for a transition from a high T regime dominated by orbital effects, to a low T regime where paramagnetic limiting drives the quenching of superconductivity, is seen. Up to 110T the upper critical field is found to be linear in T and in remarkable agreement with extrapolation of the longstanding result of Welp et al arising from magnetisation measurements to 6T. Beyond this a departure from linear behaviour occurs at T=74K, where a 3D-2D crossover is expected to occur.	1	23	19

On the level of CP-invariance an extended Pontecorvo analogy between the neutrino oscillations and the K^0-meson oscillations, which implied maximal violation of the lepton charge conservation in the neutrino mass matrix exclusively, can afford a physical clue to the three data dictated assumptions in a model with three lepton flavors and only two 4-component neutrino generations: four phenomenological neutrinos with two neutrino mass doublets, one sterile neutrino in the oscillations, and thorough maximal neutrino doublet mixing. This analogy predicts that all the four neutrino mass eigenstates are of the Majorana type.	0	7	7
hep-ph/9901396	Axionic Boson Stars in Magnetized Conducting Media	Axions are possible candidates of dark matter in the present Universe. They have been argued to form axionic boson stars with small masses $10^{-14}M_{\odot}\sim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$. Since they possess oscillating electric fields in a magnetic field, they dissipate their energies in magnetized conducting media such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. At the same time the oscillating electric fields generate a monochromatic radiation with energy equal to mass of the axion. We argue that the effect of the energy dissipation can be seen in the old white dwarfs. In particular, We show that colliding with sufficiently cooled white dwarfs, plausible candidates of MACHO, the axionic boson stars dissipate their energies in the dwarfs and heat up the dwarfs. Consequently the white dwarfs in the halo can emit detectable amount of thermal radiations with the collision. On the other hand, the monochromatic radiations can be seen only during the collision; a period of the dwarf passing the axionic boson star. Assuming that MACHO are dark white dwarfs, we show that there is a threshold in luminosity function of the white dwarfs below which the number of the white dwarfs in the halo increase discontinuously. The threshold in the luminosity function is expected to be located around $10^{-5.5}L_{\odot}\sim 10^{-7}L_{\odot}$. Its precise value is determined by the mass of the axionic boson stars dominant in the halo.	0	21	10

In addition, we analyze the fruitful framework that this connection has originated. This analysis involves the study of topological quantum field theories which contain twisted N=2 supersymmetric matter fields as well as theories obtained after twisting N=4 supersymmetry.

We argue that, when the number of time-steps, suitably scaled with respect to $\hbar$, increases, the limiting eigenvalue distribution of the Gram matrix reflects the possible quantum chaoticity of the original system as it tends to its classical limit. This idea is subsequently applied to study the long-time properties of sequences of random vectors at the time scale of the dimension of the Hilbert space of available states.	0	0	0

The main, extrinsic characterization is given in terms of behavior restricted to some subsets of second category in any closed subset of K. The concept of a strong continuity point is introduced, using the transfinite oscillations osc$_\alpha f$ of a function $f$ previously defined by the second named author. The main intrinsic characterization yields the following DSC analogue of Baire's characterization of first Baire class functions: a function belongs to DSC(K) iff its restriction to any closed non-empty set L has a strong continuity point. The characterizations yield as a corollary that a locally uniformly converging series $\sum \phi_j$ of DSC functions on K converges to a DSC function provided $\sum{osc}_\alpha \phi_j$ converges locally uniformly for all countable ordinals $\alpha$.	0	0	0

The beating of the coherent radiation with the spontaneous emission increases the noise above the shot-noise level. The excess noise is expressed in terms of the transmission and reflection matrices of the medium, and evaluated using the methods of random-matrix theory. Inter-mode scattering between $N$ propagating modes increases the noise figure by up to a factor of $N$, as one approaches the laser threshold.

astro-ph/9911060	Modelling Hard Gamma-Ray Emission From Supernova Remnants	The observation by the CANGAROO experiment of TeV emission from SN 1006, in conjunction with several instances of non-thermal X-ray emission from supernova remnants, has led to inferences of super-TeV electrons in these extended sources. While this is sufficient to propel the theoretical community in their modelling of particle acceleration and associated radiation, the anticipated emergence in the next decade of a number of new experiments probing the TeV and sub-TeV bands provides further substantial motivation for modellers. In particular, the quest for obtaining unambiguous gamma-ray signatures of cosmic ray ion acceleration defines a ``Holy Grail'' for observers and theorists alike. This review summarizes theoretical developments in the prediction of MeV-TeV gamma-rays from supernova remnants over the last five years, focusing on how global properties of models can impact, and be impacted by, hard gamma-ray observational programs, thereby probing the supernova remnant environment. Properties of central consideration include the maximum energy of accelerated particles, the density of the unshocked interstellar medium, the ambient magnetic field, and the relativistic electron-to-proton ratio. Criteria for determining good candidate remnants for observability in the TeV band are identified.	0	2	2

The order parameters are determined in a self-consistent way within the Gutzwiller approximation and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory. In sharp contrast with the nonmagnetic impurity case, the LDOS near the magnetic impurity shows two resonance peaks reflecting the presence of spin-dependent resonance states. It is also shown that these resonance states are approximately localized around the impurity.

Main attention is paid to a recently developed approach which is based on chaotic properties of compound states in the basis of non-interacting particles. In order to demonstrate the most important aspects of this approach, the matrix model of two-body random interaction between Fermi-particles has been used. Different problems have been considered such as the onset of chaos and statistical equilibrium, the relation between the structure of eigenstates and distribution of occupation numbers, the emergence of the Fermi-Dirac distribution in isolated systems of finite number of particles and many others. The application of the approach to dynamical systems with the classical limit is discussed as well.	1	2	1
hep-th/9911021	Three Family Type IIB Orientifold String Vacua with Non-Abelian Wilson Lines	We address the implementation of non-Abelian Wilson lines in D=4 N=1 Type IIB orientifold constructions. We present an explicit three-family example with the gauge group (U(4)xU(2)xSU(2)xSU(2))^2x(U(6)xSp(4))^2 and give the particle spectrum and the trilinear superpotential. Emphasizing the new subtleties associated with the introduction of non-Abelian Wilson lines, we show that the Abelian gauge anomalies are cancelled by the Green-Schwarz-type mechanism, and calculate the Fayet-Iliopoulos terms and gauge coupling corrections. The analysis thus sets a stage for further investigations of the phenomenological implications of this model.	0	41	26

These monopoles are similar to the corresponding solution with symmetrised trace structure and are existing only up to some critical value of the strength of the gravitational interaction. In addition, similar to their flat space counterpart, they also admit a critical value of the Born-Infeld parameter $\b$.	0	7	5

After deriving a BPS equation of the domain wall junction, we consider a stable hexagonal configuration of network of brane junctions, which are only approximately locally BPS. We propose a model for a mechanism of supersymmetry breaking without loss of stability, where a messenger for the SUSY breaking comes from the neighboring anti-BPS junction world, propagating along the domain walls connection them.	0	37	30
math/9911125	Dynamic monopolies of constant size	The paper deals with a polling game on a graph. Initially, each vertex is colored white or black. At each round, each vertex is colored by the color shared by the majority of vertices in its neighborhood. We say that a set of vertices is a dynamic monopoly if starting the game with the vertices of the set colored white, the entire system is white after a finite number of rounds. Peleg asked how small a dynamic monopoly may be as a function of the number of vertices. We show that the answer is O(1).	0	0	0

For positive separation ratios the main difference between the mixtures and pure fluids lies in the existence of stable three dimensional patterns near onset in a wide range of the parameter space. We evaluated the stationary solutions of roll, crossroll, and square convection and we determined the location of the stability boundaries for many parameter combinations thereby obtaining the Busse balloon for roll and square patterns.	0	5	0

Rev.} 59, 842 (1941)] concerning the Kepler-Coulomb quantum problem on the three-dimensional (3D) hypersphere is considered from the perspective of the radial Schr\"odinger equations on 3D spaces of any (either positive, zero or negative) constant curvature. Further to Stevenson, we show in detail how to get the hypergeometric wavefunction for the hydrogen atom case.

quant-ph/9911042	Spin-Boson Hamiltonian and Optical Absorption of Molecular Dimers	An analysis of the eigenstates of a symmetry-broken spin-boson Hamiltonian is performed by computing Bloch and Husimi projections. The eigenstate analysis is combined with the calculation of absorption bands of asymmetric dimer configurations constituted by monomers with nonidentical excitation energies and optical transition matrix elements. Absorption bands with regular and irregular fine structures are obtained and related to the transition from the coexistence to a mixing of adiabatic branches in the spectrum. It is shown that correlations between spin states allow for an interpolation between absorption bands for different optical asymmetries.	0	0	0

astro-ph/9907346	Correlations in the QPO Frequencies of Low Mass X-Ray Binaries and the Relativistic Precession Model	A remarkable correlation between the centroid frequencies of quasi periodic oscillations, QPOs, (or peaked noise components) from low mass X-ray binaries, has been recently discovered by Psaltis, Belloni and van der Klis (1999). This correlation extends over nearly 3 decades in frequency and encompasses both neutron star and black hole candidate systems. We discuss this result in the light of the relativistic precession model, which has been proposed to interpret the kHz QPOs as well as some of the lower frequency QPOs of neutron star low mass X-ray binaries of the Atoll and Z classes. Unlike other models the relativistic precession model does not require the compact object to be a neutron star and can be applied to black hole candidates as well. We show that the predictions of the relativistic precession model match both the value and dependence of the correlation to a very good accuracy without resorting to additional assumptions.	0	12	7
cond-mat/9907094	Stability of homogeneous magnetic phases in a generalized t-J model	We study the stability of homogeneous magnetic phases in a generalized t-J model including a same-sublattice hopping t' and nearest-neighbor repulsion V by means of the slave fermion-Schwinger boson representation of spin operators. At mean-field order we find, in agreement with other authors, that the inclusion of further-neighbor hopping and Coulomb repulsion makes the compressibility positive, thereby stabilizing at this level the spiral and Neel orders against phase separation. However, the consideration of Gaussian fluctuation of order parameters around these mean-field solutions produces unstable modes in the dynamical matrix for all relevant parameter values, leaving only reduced stability regions for the Neel phase. We have computed the one-loop corrections to the energy in these regions, and have also briefly considered the effects of the correlated hopping term that is obtained in the reduction from the Hubbard to the t-J model.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9907122	Quasi-long-range order in the random anisotropy Heisenberg model: functional renormalization group in 4-εdimensions	The large distance behaviors of the random field and random anisotropy O(N) models are studied with the functional renormalization group in 4-\epsilon dimensions. The random anisotropy Heisenberg (N=3) model is found to have a phase with the infinite correlation radius at low temperatures and weak disorder. The correlation function of the magnetization obeys a power law < m(x) m(y) >\sim |x-y|^{-0.62\epsilon}. The magnetic susceptibility diverges at low fields as \chi \sim H^{-1+0.15\epsilon}. In the random field O(N) model the correlation radius is found to be finite at the arbitrarily weak disorder for any N>3. The random field case is studied with a new simple method, based on a rigorous inequality. This approach allows one to avoid the integration of the functional renormalization group equations.	1	2	1
cond-mat/9907173	Magnetic reconstruction at (001) CaMnO$_3$ surface	The Mn-terminated (001) surface of the stable anti-ferromagnetic insulating phase of cubic perovskite CaMnO$_3$ is found to undergo a magnetic reconstruction consisting on a spin-flip process at surface: each Mn spin at the surface flips to pair with that of Mn in the subsurface layer. In spite of very little Mn-O charge transfer at surface, the surface behavior is driven by the $e_g$ states due to $d_{xy}$ $\to$ $d_{z^2}$ charge redistribution. These results, based on local spin density theory, give a double exchange like coupling that is driven by $e_g$ character, not additional charge, and may have relevance to CMR materials.	1	1	0
cond-mat/9907328	Optical and Magneto-optical Response of a Doped Mott Insulator	We study the optical, Raman, and ac Hall response of the doped Mott insulator within the dynamical mean-field theory ($d=\infty$) for strongly correlated electron systems. The occurence of the {\it isosbectic} point in the optical conductivity is shown to be associated with the frequency dependence of the generalized charge susceptibility. We compute the Raman response, which probes the fluctuations of the "stress tensor", and show that the scattering is characterized by appreciable incoherent contributions. The calculated ac Hall constant and Hall angle also exhibit the isosbectic points. These results are also compared with those obtained for a {\it non-FL} metal in $d=\infty$. The role of low-energy coherence (FL) or incoherence (non-FL) in determining the finite frequency response of strongly correlated metals in $d=\infty$ is discussed in detail.	1	6	6

Thereby we obtain a description of the entire crossover from the bulk BCS regime (mean level spacing $d\ll$ bulk gap $\tilde\Delta$) to the `fluctuation-dominated' few-electron regime ($d\gg\tilde\Delta$). A wave-function analysis shows in detail how the BCS limit is recovered and how for $d\gg\tilde\Delta$ pairing correlations become delocalized in energy space.	1	3	1
cond-mat/9907416	Dynamic correlations in doped 1D Kondo insulator: Finite-T DMRG study	The finite-T DMRG method is applied to the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model to calculate dynamic correlation functions. Dynamic spin and charge correlations, S_f(omega), S_c(omega), and N_c(omega), and quasiparticle density of states rho(omega) are calculated in the paramagnetic metallic phase for various temperatures and hole densities. Near half filling, it is shown that a pseudogap grows in these dynamic correlation functions below the crossover temperature characterized by the spin gap at half filling. A sharp peak at omega=0 evolves at low temperatures in S_f(omega) and N_c(omega). This may be an evidence of the formation of the collective excitations, and this confirms that the metallic phase is a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the low temperature limit.	1	2	1
gr-qc/9907004	Refined Algebraic Quantization in the oscillator representation of SL(2,R)	We investigate Refined Algebraic Quantization (RAQ) with group averaging in a constrained Hamiltonian system with unreduced phase space T^*R^4 and gauge group SL(2,R). The reduced phase space M is connected and contains four mutually disconnected `regular' sectors with topology R x S^1, but these sectors are connected to each other through an exceptional set where M is not a manifold and where M has non-Hausdorff topology. The RAQ physical Hilbert space H_{phys} decomposes as H_{phys} = (direct sum of) H_i, where the four subspaces H_i naturally correspond to the four regular sectors of M. The RAQ observable algebra A_{obs}, represented on H_{phys}, contains natural subalgebras represented on each H_i. The group averaging takes place in the oscillator representation of SL(2,R) on L^2(R^{2,2}), and ensuring convergence requires a subtle choice for the test state space: the classical analogue of this choice is to excise from M the exceptional set while nevertheless retaining information about the connections between the regular sectors. A quantum theory with the Hilbert space H_{phys} and a finitely-generated observable subalgebra of A_{obs} is recovered through both Ashtekar's Algebraic Quantization and Isham's group theoretic quantization.	0	19	16
gr-qc/9907023	On a class of invariant coframe operators with application to gravity	Let a differential 4D-manifold with a smooth coframe field be given. Consider the operators on it that are linear in the second order derivatives or quadratic in the first order derivatives of the coframe, both with coefficients that depend on the coframe variables. The paper exhibits the class of operators that are invariant under a general change of coordinates, and, also, invariant under the global SO(1,3)-transformation of the coframe. A general class of field equations is constructed. We display two subclasses in it. The subclass of field equations that are derivable from action principles by free variations and the subclass of field equations for which spherical-symmetric solutions, Minkowskian at infinity exist. Then, for the spherical-symmetric solutions, the resulting metric is computed. Invoking the Geodesic Postulate, we find all the equations that are experimentally (by the 3 classical tests) indistinguishable from Einstein field equations. This family includes, of course, also Einstein equations. Moreover, it is shown, explicitly, how to exhibit it. The basic tool employed in the paper is an invariant formulation reminiscent of Cartan's structural equations. The article sheds light on the possibilities and limitations of the coframe gravity. It may also serve as a general procedure to derive covariant field equations.	0	12	9

The measurement is performed in a region of small angles with respect to the proton remnant in the laboratory frame of reference, namely the forward region, and corresponds to central rapidity in the centre of mass system of the virtual photon and proton. This region is expected to be particularly sensitive to QCD effects in hadronic final states. Differential cross-sections for inclusive pi0-meson production are presented as a function of Bjorken-x and the four-momentum transfer Q^2, and as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. A recent numerical BFKL calculation and predictions from QCD models based on DGLAP parton evolution are compared with the data.	0	28	13
hep-ph/9907260	Neutral kaons as decay products and analyzers of heavier flavors	Cascade decays of heavy flavor hadrons to states with neutral kaons are discussed as an instrument for detailed studies of the heavy hadron properties. For neutral flavored mesons the well-known kaon oscillations provide a unique experimental possibility of relating lighter/heavier eigenstate masses to (approximate) even/odd eigenstate CP-parities and to longer/shorter eigenstate lifetimes. As a result, they allow to eliminate sign ambiguities of CP-violating parameters and, therefore, to check the Standard Model (or to find New Physics). Specifically for charmed hadrons, both neutral/charged mesons and baryons, the secondary kaon oscillations permit unambiguous separation of Cabibbo-allowed and doubly-suppressed decay amplitudes, including measurement of their relative phases. For neutral $D$-meson decays the kaon oscillations can also discriminate, again unambiguously, between effects of $D$-meson mixing and interference of suppressed/allowed amplitudes. Another problem discussed is the influence of kaon CP-violation on the amplitude structure and on phenomenology of CP-violation in heavy hadron decays.	0	1	1

It means that in this interaction the additive numbers cannot be conserved. These results are the consequence of specific character of the weak interaction: the right components of spinors do not participate in this interaction. The schemes of violation of the aromatic and lepton numbers were considered.	0	0	0

In particular, we show that in $d=4, \mathcal{N}=1$ compactifications along manifolds of $G_2$ holonomy, membranes wrapped on rigid supersymmetric 3-cycles induce nonzero corrections to the superpotential. Thus, membrane instantons destabilize many M-theory compactifications. Our computation shows that the low energy description of membrane physics is usefully described in terms of three-dimensional topological field theories, and the superpotential is expressed in terms of topological invariants of the 3-cycle. We discuss briefly some applications of these results. For example, using mirror symmetry we derive a counting formula for supersymmetric three-cycles in certain Calabi-Yau manifolds.	0	157	142

The Landau-Ginzburg approach enables us to provide a target space interpretation for the boundary states. The boundary states are obtained by applying Cardy's procedure to combinations of characters in the Gepner models which are invariant under spectral flow. We are able to relate the two descriptions using the common discrete symmetries of the two descriptions. We are thus able to provide an extension to the boundary of the bulk correspondence between Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and the corresponding Gepner models.	0	64	63
hep-th/9907167	Short-distance analysis for algebraic euclidean field theory	Recently D. Buchholz and R. Verch have proposed a method for implementing in algebraic quantum field theory ideas from renormalization group analysis of short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing to certain scaling limit theories. Buchholz and Verch distinguish between different types of theories where the limit is unique, degenerate, or classical, and the method allows in principle to extract the `ultraparticle' content of a given model, i.e. to identify particles (like quarks and gluons) that are not visible at finite distances due to `confinement'. It is therefore of great importance for the physical interpretation of the theory. The method has been illustrated in a simple model in with some rather surprising results. This paper will focus on the question how the short distance behavior of models defined by euclidean means is reflected in the corresponding behavior of their Minkowski counterparts. More specifically, we shall prove that if a euclidean theory has some short distance limit, then it is possible to pass from this limit theory to a theory on Minkowski space, which is a short distance limit of the Minkowski space theory corresponding to the original euclidean theory.	0	2	2

This is based on a simple combinatorial structure called shells and the formal composites of pasting diagrams based on the closure of open shells. We give two types of graphical representation of higher dimensional cells which show effectively the relationship of cells of different dimensions. Using the hypergraphs, we define strict hypercategories and illustrate its use by taking Lafont's interaction combinator as an example. We also give a definition of weak $\omega$-hypercategories and show that usual category is identified with a special kind of weak hypercategory as an illustration of arguments provided by our framework In the replacement of 9 Aug, an omission of an important condition in the definition of shells is corrected. We are preparing two papers which develop two themes roughly presented in this preprint: (1) Hiroyuki Miyoshi and Toru Tsujishita, Weak $\omega$-Categories as $\omega$-Hypergraphs, presented at CT99, International Category Theory Meeting Category Theory, July 1999, Coimbra, and (2) Akira Huguchi and Toru Tsujishita, Strict $n$-hypercategories, after completion of which this manuscript will be withdrawn.	0	1	1

To shed light on the nature of these interactions, we have carried out ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on complexes representing adducts between the reaction intermediate and elastase (one protein belonging to the SP family). Our calculations indicate the presence of a low--barrier H-bond between His-57 and Asp-102, in complete agreement with NMR experiments on enzyme--transition state analog complexes. Comparison with an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation on a model of the substrate--enzyme adduct indicates that the Gly-193--induced strong stabilization of the intermediate is accomplished by charge/dipole interactions and not by H-bonding as previously suggested. Inclusion of the protein electric field in the calculations does not affect significantly the charge distribution.	0	0	0

This letter is dedicated to the question if this is really the case when the role of dissipation and noise -- the two concurrent phenomena present in these biological structures -- is taken into account.

The reduction of the Casimir energy in the same configuration is also calculated. It can be used to infer the reduction of the force in the plane-sphere geometry through the `proximity theorem'. Frequency dependent dielectric response functions of the metals are represented either by the simple plasma model or, more accurately, by using the optical data known for the metals used in recent experiments, that is Al, Au and Cu. In the two latter cases, the results obtained here differ significantly from those published recently.	0	121	88

The redshift is determined by the onset of the Lyman-alpha forest at lambda ~ 6800 A, and a Lyman Limit System at lambda = 5120 A. A strong Ly_alpha absorption system with weak metal absorption lines at z=4.58 is also identified in the spectrum. The object has a continuum absolute magnitude of -26.6 at 1450 A in the rest-frame (h_0=0.5, q_0=0.5), and therefore cannot be an ordinary galaxy. It shows no radio emission (the 3-sigma upper limit of its flux at 6 cm is 60 micron Jy), indicating an radio-to-optical flux ratio at least as small as that of the radio-weakest known BL Lacs. It is also not linearly polarized in the observed I band to a 3-sigma upper limit of 4%. Therefore, it is either the most distant BL Lac object known to date, with very weak radio emission, or a new type of unbeamed quasar, whose broad emission-line region is very weak or absent.	0	32	32
astro-ph/9910173	The Northern Sky Optical Cluster Survey I: Detection of Galaxy Clusters in DPOSS	The Northern Sky Optical Cluster Survey is a project to create an objective catalog of galaxy clusters over the entire high-galactic-latitude Northern sky, with well understood selection criteria. We use the object catalogs generated from the Digitized Second Palomar Sky Survey (DPOSS, Djorgovski et al. 1999) as the basis for this survey. We apply a color criterion to select against field galaxies, and use a simple adaptive kernel technique to create galaxy density maps, combined with the bootstrap technique to make significance maps, from which density peaks are selected. This survey attempts to eliminate some of the subjective criteria and assumptions of past surveys, including detection by eye (Abell 1958, ACO 1989) and assumed luminosity functions and cluster profiles (PDCS, Postman et al. 1995). We also utilize more information (especially colors) than the most similar recent survey, the APM (Dalton et al. 1992). This paper presents the details of our cluster detection technique, as well as some initial results for two small areas totaling ~60 square degrees. We find a mean surface density of ~1.5 clusters per square degree, consistent with the detection of richness class 0 and higher clusters to z~0.3. In addition, we demonstrate an effective photometric redshift estimator for our clusters.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9910263	Pseudo-High-Order Symplectic Integrators	Symplectic N-body integrators are widely used to study problems in celestial mechanics. The most popular algorithms are of 2nd and 4th order, requiring 2 and 6 substeps per timestep, respectively. The number of substeps increases rapidly with order in timestep, rendering higher-order methods impractical. However, symplectic integrators are often applied to systems in which perturbations between bodies are a small factor of the force due to a dominant central mass. In this case, it is possible to create optimized symplectic algorithms that require fewer substeps per timestep. This is achieved by only considering error terms of order epsilon, and neglecting those of order epsilon^2, epsilon^3 etc. Here we devise symplectic algorithms with 4 and 6 substeps per step which effectively behave as 4th and 6th-order integrators when epsilon is small. These algorithms are more efficient than the usual 2nd and 4th-order methods when applied to planetary systems.	0	1	1

cond-mat/9910332	Emergence of scaling in random networks	Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the world wide web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature is found to be a consequence of the two generic mechanisms that networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and new vertices attach preferentially to already well connected sites. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, indicating that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.	1	2636	317
cond-mat/9910382	Muon-Spin Rotation Spectra in the Mixed Phase of High-T_c Superconductors : Thermal Fluctuations and Disorder Effects	We study muon-spin rotation (muSR) spectra in the mixed phase of highly anisotropic layered superconductors, specifically Bi_2+xSr_2-xCaCu_2O_8+delta (BSCCO), by modeling the fluid and solid phases of pancake vortices using liquid-state and density functional methods. The role of thermal fluctuations in causing motional narrowing of muSR lineshapes is quantified in terms of a first-principles theory of the flux-lattice melting transition. The effects of random point pinning are investigated using a replica treatment of liquid state correlations and a replicated density functional theory. Our results indicate that motional narrowing in the pure system, although substantial, cannot account for the remarkably small linewidths obtained experimentally at relatively high fields and low temperatures. We find that satisfactory agreement with the muSR data for BSCCO in this regime can be obtained through the ansatz that this ``phase'' is characterized by frozen short-range positional correlations reflecting the structure of the liquid just above the melting transition. This proposal is consistent with recent suggestions of a ``pinned liquid'' or ``glassy'' state of pancake vortices in the presence of pinning disorder. Our results for the high-temperature liquid phase indicate that measurable linewidths may be obtained in this phase as a consequence of density inhomogeneities induced by the pinning disorder. The results presented here comprise a unified, first-principles theoretical treatment of muSR spectra in highly anisotropic layered superconductors in terms of a controlled set of approximations.	1	9	9
cond-mat/9910457	Topological effects in ring polymers (II): Influence of persistence length	The interplay of topological constraints and persistence length of ring polymers in their own melt is investigated by means of dynamical Monte Carlo simulations of a three dimensional lattice model. We ask if the results are consistent with an asymptotically regime where the rings behave like (compact) {\em lattice animals} in a self-consistent network of topological constraints imposed by neighbouring rings. Tuning the persistence length provides an efficient route to increase the ring overlap required for this mean-field picture to hold: The {\em effective} Flory exponent for the ring size decreases down to $\nu \stackrel{<}{\sim} 1/3$ with increasing persistence length. Evidence is provided for the emergence of one additional characteristic length scale $\dtop \propto N^0$, only weakly dependent on the persistence length and much larger than the excluded volume screening length $\xi$. At distances larger than \dtop the conformational properties of the rings are governed by the topological interactions, at smaller distances rings and their linear chain counterparts become similar. (At distances smaller than $\xi$ both architectures are identical.) However, the crossover between both limits is intricate and broad as a detailed discussion of the local fractal dimension (e.g., obtained from the static structure factor) reveals.	1	0	0
cond-mat/9910464	Correlations in optical phonon spectra of complex solids	Spectral correlations in the optical phonon spectrum of a solid with a complex unit cell are analysed using the Wigner-Dyson statistical approach. Despite the fact that all force constants are real, we find that the statistics are predominantly of the GUE type depending on the location within the Brillouin zone of a crystal and the unit cell symmetry. Analytic and numerical results for the crossover from GOE to GUE statistics are presented.	1	0	0
hep-ph/9910411	Gluon penguin enhancements to inclusive charmless decays of b quark in the 2HDM with flavor changing couplings	We calculate the enhancements to the inclusive charmless decays of b quark, $b \to s g, s q\bar{q}, sgg$, from gluon penguin diagrams induced by the charged and neutral Higgs bosons $(H^{\pm}, h^0, H^0$, and A^0) in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with flavor-changing couplings. Within the considered parameter space, the new contributions from charged Higgs boson are dominant. After including the new contributions, the branching ratio $BR(b \to sg)$ (q^2 =0) can be increased form $\sim 0.2%$ in the standard model to 4.4% and 2.6% in the two-Higgs-doublet model for $m_{H^+}=100$ and 200 GeV, respectively. The new contribution to the decay mode $b \to s q \bar{q}$ with q=(u,d,s) is, however, numerically small and peaked at the lower q^2 region. The new contribution to $b \to s gg$ can also be neglected.	0	19	19

The Hamiltonian responsible for the transition is the strong interacting one. The experimental data are described using the isospin symmetry relations between the strong coupling constants.	0	6	6

The prospects are robust for the usual Higgs boson and supersymmetry benchmarks. With an integrated luminosity of 40 fb$^{-1}$, discoveries at 5$\sigma$ could be made for a standard Higgs boson of mass $\alt 680$ GeV (600 GeV for 10 fb$^{-1}$), a lighter chargino of mass $\alt 380$ GeV, and an extra $Z$ boson of mass $\alt 2.6$ TeV; four-fermion contact interactions from new physics with scale $\alt 74$ TeV could be excluded at the 95% confidence level.	0	2	2
hep-ph/9910535	Quantum Transport Equations for a Scalar Field	We derive quantum Boltzmann equations from Schwinger-Dyson equations in gradient expansion for a weakly coupled scalar field theory with a spatially varying mass. We find that at higher order in gradients a full description of the system requires specifying not only an on shell distribution function but also a finite number of its derivatives, or equivalently its higher moments. These derivatives describe quantum coherence arising as a consequence of localization in position space. We then show that in the limit of frequent scatterings coherent quantum effects are suppressed, and the transport equations reduce to the single Boltzmann equation for particle density, in which particles flow along modified semiclassical trajectories in phase space.	0	13	11

We also investigate the further restrictions of conformal and superconformal invariance. In particular, we construct conformal N=4 extensions of the A_{M-1} Calogero models, which for generic values of the coupling constant are not SU(1,1|2) superconformal. This class of models is also extended to arbitrary (even) N. We give both hamiltonian and (classical) lagrangean formulations. In the latter case we use both component and N=4 superfield formulations.	0	53	51

Coulomb asymptotics in the harmonic oscillator representation of scattering theory	The relation between the R- and P-matrix approaches and the harmonic oscillator representation of the quantum scattering theory (J-matrix method) is discussed. We construct a discrete analogue of the P-matrix that is shown to be equivalent to the usual P-matrix in the quasiclassical limit. A definition of the natural channel radius is introduced. As a result, it is shown to be possible to use well-developed technique of R- and P-matrix theory for calculation of resonant states characteristics, scattering phase shifts, etc., in the approaches based on harmonic oscillator expansions, e.g., in nuclear shell-model calculations. P-matrix is used also for formulation of the method of treating Coulomb asymptotics in the scattering theory in oscillator representation.	0	0	0

We show that it can be reliably calculated within the eikonal approximation for the reaction part. The formalism is applied to the charge-pickup cross sections of 158 GeV/nucleon Pb projectiles on several targets. The relative contributions of pion- and rho-exchange are determined, using a single-particle model for the internal structure of the nuclei. The calculated cross sections are non-negligible for heavy targets. It is shown that these cross sections can be useful to obtain information on the Gamow-Teller transition strengths of the nuclei.	0	12	11
physics/9910025	Fractal features of dark, maintained, and driven neural discharges in the cat visual system	We employ a number of statistical measures to characterize neural discharge activity in cat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in their target lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons under various stimulus conditions, and we develop a new measure to examine correlations in fractal activity between spike-train pairs. In the absence of stimulation (i.e., in the dark), RGC and LGN discharges exhibit similar properties. The presentation of a constant, uniform luminance to the eye reduces the fractal fluctuations in the RGC maintained discharge but enhances them in the target LGN discharge, so that neural activity in the pair no longer mirror each other. A drifting-grating stimulus yields RGC and LGN driven spike trains similar in character to those observed in the maintained discharge, with two notable distinctions: action potentials are reorganized along the time axis so that they occur only during certain phases of the stimulus waveform, and fractal activity is suppressed. Under both uniform-luminance and drifting-grating stimulus conditions (but not in the dark), the discharges of pairs of LGN cells are highly correlated over long time scales; in contrast discharges of RGCs are nearly uncorrelated with each other. This indicates that action-potential activity at the LGN is subject to a common fractal modulation to which the RGCs are not subjected.	0	0	0
quant-ph/9910039	Maximum predictive power and the superposition principle	Recently, there has been a discussion on the origin of the quantum probability rules (Deutsch quant-ph/9906015, Polley quant-ph/9906124, Barnum et al. quant-ph/9907024, Finkelstein quant-ph/9907004). This contribution, which is a slightly reformulated version of a paper published in Int.J.Theor.Phys. 33, 171 (1994), points out the follwoing: To an experimenter the world is a persistent stream of discrete data. All that is certain is that with each observation he/she knows more than before, simply because he/she can now answer the question "Which of the possible outcomes have you just registered?", while this was not possible before the observation. One can ask whether this relentless increase of information entails a specific structure. In particular, how must different observations be related in order to ensure that predictions become ever more accurate, the more past observations serve as input? This leads to the quantum rule for adding the complex square roots of probabilities, and not to adding the probabilities themselves, as classical probability would have it.	0	7	7
quant-ph/9910084	Detection devices in entanglement-based optical state preparation	We study the use of detection devices in entanglement-based state preparation. In particular we consider optical detection devices such as single-photon sensitivity detectors, single-photon resolution detectors and detector cascades (with an emphasis on the performance of realistic detectors). We develop an extensive theory for the use of these devices. In entanglement-based state preparation we perform measurements on subsystems, and we therefore need precise bounds on the distinguishability of these measurements (this is fundamentally different from, e.g., tomography, where an ensemble of identical states is used to determine probability distributions, etc.). To this end, we introduce the confidence of preparation, which may also be used to quantify the performance of detection devices in entanglement-based preparation. We give a general expression for detector cascades of arbitrary size for the detection up to two photons. We show that, contrary to the general belief, cascading does not give a practical advantage over detectors with single-photon resolution in entanglement-based state preparation.	0	49	48
astro-ph/9908026	A Shotgun Model for Gamma Ray Bursts	We propose that gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by a shower of heavy blobs running into circumstellar material at highly relativistic speeds. The gamma ray emission is produced in the shocks these bullets drive into the surrounding medium. The short term variability seen in GRBs is set by the slowing-down time of the bullets while the overall duration of the burst is set by the lifetime of the central engine. A requirement of this model is that the ambient medium be dense, consistent with a strong stellar wind. The efficiency of the burst can be relatively high.	0	4	4
astro-ph/9908095	A class of self-gravitating accretion disks	We consider a class of steady-state self-gravitating accretion disks for which efficient cooling mechanisms are assumed to operate so that the disk is self-regulated at a condition of approximate marginal Jeans stability. In an earlier paper, this scenario had been shown to lead naturally, in the absence of a central point mass, to a self-similar solution characterized by a flat rotation curve. In this article we investigate the entire parameter space available for such self-regulated accretion disks and provide two non-trivial extensions of the model. The first extension is that of a bimodal disk, obtained by partially relaxing the self-regulation constraint, so that full matching with an inner "standard" Keplerian accretion disk takes place. The second extension is the construction of self-regulated accretion disks embedded in a diffuse spherical "halo". The analysis is further strengthened by a careful discussion of the vertical structure of the disk, in such a way that the transition from self-gravity dominated to non-gravitating disks is covered uniformly.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9908181	Spectroscopic investigation of old planetaries IV. Model atmosphere analysis	The results of a NLTE model atmosphere analysis of 27 hydrogen-rich central stars of old planetary nebulae (PN) are reported. These stars were selected from a previous paper in this series, where we gave classifications for a total of 38 central stars. Most of the analyzed central stars fill a previously reported gap in the hydrogen-rich evolutionary sequence. Our observations imply the existence of two separated spectral evolutionary sequences for hydrogen-rich and -poor central stars/white dwarfs. This is in line with theoretical evolutionary calculations, which predict that most post-AGB stars reach the white dwarf domain with a thick hydrogen envelope of approx. 10^-4 Msun. We determine stellar masses from the comparison with evolutionary tracks and derive a mass distribution for the hydrogen-rich central stars of old PNe. The peak mass and the general shape of the distribution is in agreement with recent determinations of the white dwarf mass distribution. The properties of most analyzed stars are well explained by standard post-AGB evolution. However, for eight stars of the sample other scenarios have to be invoked. A wide spread of helium abundances is observed in the photospheres of central stars of old PNe. It is shown that a good correlation between helium abundances and luminosity is present. It is inferred that when the stars' luminosities fall below L = 300Lsun depletion starts and the helium abundance steadily decreases with decreasing luminosity. The existence of this correlation is in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical calculations of gravitational settling in the presence of a stellar wind.	0	3	3
cond-mat/9908127	Synchronization of non-chaotic dynamical systems	A synchronization mechanism driven by annealed noise is studied for two replicas of a coupled-map lattice which exhibits stable chaos (SC), i.e. irregular behavior despite a negative Lyapunov spectrum. We show that the observed synchronization transition, on changing the strength of the stochastic coupling between replicas, belongs to the directed percolation universality class. This result is consistent with the behavior of chaotic deterministic cellular automata (DCA), supporting the equivalence Ansatz between SC models and DCA. The coupling threshold above which the two system replicas synchronize is strictly related to the propagation velocity of perturbations in the system.	1	5	3

The boundary $K$ matrices depending on the local magnetic moments of the impurities are presented as nontrivial realizations of the reflection equation algebras in an impurity Hilbert space. Furthermore, these models are solved by using the algebraic Bethe ansatz method and the Bethe ansatz equations are obtained.	1	3	1
cond-mat/9908339	Tunable Charge Density Wave Transport in a Current-Effect Transistor	The collective charge density wave (CDW) conduction is modulated by a transverse single-particle current in a transistor-like device. Nonequilibrium conditions in this geometry lead to an exponential reduction of the depinning threshold, allowing the CDWs to slide for much lower bias fields. The results are in excellent agreement with a recently proposed dynamical model in which ''wrinkles'' in the CDW wavefronts are ''ironed'' by the transverse current. The experiment might have important implications for other driven periodic media, such as moving vortex lattices or ''striped phases'' in high-Tc superconductors.	1	1	0

For this U, the calculation predicts a 5f5 atomic-like configuration with L=5, S=5/2, and J=5/2 and shows a nearly complete compensation between spin and orbital magnetic moments.	1	2	2

We consider implications of this symmetry for magneto-optical transitions. It is shown, in particular, that in a translationally-invariant system with a simple valence band, the ground triplet X- state is dark in interband transitions at finite magnetic fields B. This exact result calls for the re-interpretation of several previous theoretical studies. We consider the symmetry-breaking effects of spatial lateral confinement on internal transitions of charged complexes.	1	3	3

Our approach is primarily dynamical and is based on the convergence of a zero-temperature dynamical process with flips of lattice animals up to size M and starting from a deep quench, to a metastable limit. The results (rigorous and nonrigorous, in infinite and finite volumes) concern many aspects of metastable states: their numbers, basins of attraction, energy densities, overlaps, remanent magnetizations and relations to thermodynamic states. For example, we show that their overlap distribution is a delta-function at zero. We also define a dynamics for M=infinity, which provides a potential tool for investigating ground state structure.	1	20	12

For the Lorentzian signature, we find that the resultant power series can be expressed as a sum over branched, colored two-surfaces with an intrinsic causal structure. This leads us to define a general structure which we call a ``causal spin foam''. We also demonstrate that the causal evolution models for spin networks fall in the general class of causal spin foams.	0	10	6

Initial-to-final state color interference effects are studied by examining particle distribution patterns in events with a W boson and at least one jet.

hep-ph/9908310	Magnetic Interactions, the Renormalization Group and Color Superconductivity in High Density QCD	We investigate the effect of long range magnetic interactions on the renormalization group (RG) evolution of local Cooper pairing interactions near the Fermi surface in high density QCD. We use an explicit cut-off on momentum modes, with special emphasis on screening effects such as Landau damping, to derive the RG equations in a gauge invariant, weak coupling expansion. We obtain the Landau pole $\Delta \sim \mu g^{-5} \exp(- \frac{3 \pi^2}{\sqrt{2} g})$, although the structure of our equations differs from previous results. We also investigate the gap equation, including condensates of higher angular momentum. We show that rotational invariance is unbroken at asymptotically high density, and verify that $\Delta$ is the correct value of the gap when higher modes are included in the analysis.	0	115	94

The calculations for secondary $J/\psi$ and $\psi^,$ production are performed within a kinetic model taking into account the space-time evolution of a longitudinally and transversely expanding medium. It is shown that the yield of secondary $J/\psi$ mesons depends strongly on the $J/\psi$ dissociation cross section with co-moving hadrons. Within the most likely scenario for the dissociation cross section it will be negligible. The secondary production of $\psi^,$ mesons, however, due to their large cross section above the threshold, can substantially exceed the primary yield.	0	14	9
quant-ph/9908043	Ultimate physical limits to computation	Computers are physical systems: what they can and cannot do is dictated by the laws of physics. In particular, the speed with which a physical device can process information is limited by its energy and the amount of information that it can process is limited by the number of degrees of freedom it possesses. This paper explores the physical limits of computation as determined by the speed of light $c$, the quantum scale $\hbar$ and the gravitational constant $G$. As an example, quantitative bounds are put to the computational power of an `ultimate laptop' with a mass of one kilogram confined to a volume of one liter.	0	25	8
quant-ph/9908060	Bogoliubov dispersion relation for a "photon fluid": Is this a superfluid?	We discuss the possibility that photons, which are bosons, can form a 2D superfluid due to Bose-Einstein condensation inside a nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity filled with atoms in their ground states. A "photon fluid" forms inside the cavity as a result of multiple photon-photon collisions mediated by the atoms during a cavity ring-down time. The effective mass and chemical potential for a photon inside this fluid are nonvanishing. This implies the existence of a Bogoliubov dispersion relation for the low-lying elementary excitations of the photon fluid, and in particular, that sound waves exist for long-wavelength, low-frequency disturbances of this fluid. Possible experiments to test for the superfluidity of the photon fluid based on the Landau critical-velocity criterion will be discussed.	0	1	0
astro-ph/9905013	X-ray Properties of the Weak Seyfert 1 Nucleus in NGC 4639	We obtained observations of NGC 4639 with ASCA in order to investigate its mildly active Seyfert 1 nucleus at hard X-ray energies. Koratkar et al. (1995) have previously shown that the nucleus is a pointlike source in the ROSAT soft X-ray band. We detected in the 2-10 keV band a compact central source with a luminosity of 8.3E+40 erg/s. Comparison of the ASCA data with archival data taken with the Einstein and ROSAT satellites shows that the nucleus varies on timescales of months to years. The variability could be intrinsic, or it could be caused by variable absorption. More rapid variability, on a timescale of \~10^4 s, may be present in the ASCA data. The spectrum from 0.5 to 10 keV is well described by a model consisting of a lightly absorbed (N_H = 7.3E+20 cm^-2) power law with a photon index of 1.68. We find no evidence for significant emission from a thermal plasma; if present, it can account for no more than 25% of the flux in the 0.5-2.0 keV band. The limited photon statistics of our data do not allow us to place significant limits on the presence of iron K emission. (abridged)	0	0	0
astro-ph/9905078	Observations of short-duration X-ray transients by WATCH on Granat	During 1990-92, the WATCH all-sky X-ray monitor on Granat discovered six short-duration X-ray transients. In this paper we discuss their possible relationship to peculiar stars. Only one of the fast (few hours) X-ray transients (GRS 1100-771) might be tentatively ascribed to a superflare arising from a young stellar object in the Chamaeleon I star-forming cloud. At the distance of 150 pc, Lx = 1.35 x 10E34 erg/s (8-15 keV), or 2.6 x 10E34 erg/s (0.1-2.4 keV) assuming a thermal spectrum with kT = 10 keV, a temperature higher than those previously seen in T Tauri stars (Tsuboi et al. 1998). The peak X-ray luminosity is at least 2 times higher than that derived for the protostar IRS 43 (Grosso et al. 1997) which would make -to our knowledge- the strongest flare ever seen in a young stellar object. However, the possibility of GRS 1100-771 being an isolated neutron star unrelated to the cloud cannot be excluded, given the relatively large error box provided by WATCH. Regarding the longer duration (about 1 day) X-ray transients, none of them seem to be related to known objects. We suggest that the latter are likely to have originated from compact objects in low-mass or high-mass X-ray binaries, similarly to XTE J0421+560.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9905253	On the equipartition of thermal and non-thermal energy in clusters of galaxies	Clusters of galaxies are revealing themselves as powerful sources of non thermal radiation in a wide range of wavelengths. In order to account for these multifrequency observations equipartition of cosmic rays (CRs) with the thermal gas in clusters of galaxies is often invoked. This condition might suggest a dynamical role played by cosmic rays in the virialization of these large scale structures and is now testable through gamma ray observations. We show here, in the specific case of the Coma and Virgo clusters, for which upper limits on the gamma ray emission exist, that equipartition implies gamma ray fluxes that are close or even in excess of the EGRET limit, depending on the adopted model of CR injection. We use this bound to limit the validity of the equipartition condition. We also show that, contrary to what claimed in previous calculations, the equipartition assumption implies gamma ray fluxes in the TeV range which can be detectable even by currently operating gamma ray observatories if the injection cosmic ray spectrum is flatter than $E^{-2.4}$.	0	28	28

cond-mat/9905246	First-Principles Calculations of Hyperfine Interactions in La_2CuO_4	We present the results of first-principles cluster calculations of the electronic structure of La_2CuO_4. Several clusters containing up to nine copper atoms embedded in a background potential were investigated. Spin-polarized calculations were performed both at the Hartree-Fock level and with density functional methods with generalized gradient corrections to the local density approximation. The distinct results for the electronic structure obtained with these two methods are discussed. The dependence of the electric-field gradients at the Cu and the O sites on the cluster size is studied and the results are compared to experiments. The magnetic hyperfine coupling parameters are carefully examined. Special attention is given to a quantitative determination of on-site and transferred hyperfine fields. We provide a detailed analysis that compares the hyperfine fields obtained for various cluster sizes with results from additional calculations of spin states with different multiplicities. From this we conclude that hyperfine couplings are mainly transferred from nearest neighbor Cu^{2+} ions and that contributions from further distant neighbors are marginal. The mechanisms giving rise to transfer of spin density are worked out. Assuming conventional values for the spin-orbit coupling, the total calculated hyperfine interaction parameters are compared to informations from experiments.	1	1	1

cond-mat/9905426	Testing quantum correlations in a confined atomic cloud by scattering fast atoms: Direct and time reversed processes	We suggest measuring the one-particle density matrix of a trapped ultracold atomic cloud by scattering fast atoms in a pure momentum state off the cloud. The lowest-order probability for the process, resulting in a pair of outcoming fast atoms for each incoming one, as well as of its time reversed counterpart, turns out to be given by the Fourier transform of the density matrix. Accordingly, important information about quantum correlations can be deduced directly from the differential scattering cross-section of these processes. Several most interesting cases of scattering - from a single condensate containing a vortex, and from a split condensate characterized by some phase difference - are discussed.	1	0	0
gr-qc/9905046	Fock-Lorentz transformations and time-varying speed of light	The theory of relativity was built up on linear Lorentz transformation. However, in his fundamental work "Theory of Space, Time and Gravitation" V.A.Fock shows that the general form of the transformation between the coordinates in the two inertial frames could be taken to be linear fractional. The implicit form of this transformation contains two constants of different space-time dimensions. They can be reduced to the constant "c" with the dimension of speed ("speed of light"), and to the constant "R" with the dimension of length (an invariant radius of the visible part of the Universe). The geometry of the "light cones" shows that "R" is a fundamental constant, but "c" depends on the time of transformation.	0	30	17

A comparison of the data with a model based on no nuclear effects at large x, shows a significant excess of events in the data. Addition of Fermi gas motion of the nucleons in the nucleus to the model does not explain the excess. Adding a higher momentum tail due to the formation of ``quasi-deuterons'' makes some improvement. An exponentially falling F_2 \propto e^-s(x-x_0) at large x, predicted by ``multi-quark clusters'' and ``few-nucleon correlations'', can describe the data. A value of s=8.3 \pm 0.7(stat.)\pm 0.7(sys.) yields the best agreement with the data.	0	17	4

A disorder parameter $\leftangle\mu\rightangle$ is defined dual to the magnetization $\leftangle\vec n\rightangle$, which signals condensation of vortices, i.e. spontaneous breaking of the dual U(1) symmetry.

hep-ph/9905291	Pade-Summation Approach to QCD Beta-Function Infrared Properties	We address whether Pad\'e-summations of the $\bar{MS}$ QCD $\beta$-function for a given number of flavours exhibit an infrared-stable fixed point, or alternatively, an infrared attractor of a double valued couplant as noted by Kogan and Shifman for the case of supersymmetric gluodynamics. Below an approximant-dependent flavour threshold $(6 \leq n_f \leq 8)$, we find that Pad\'e-summation $\beta$-functions incorporating $[2|1], [1|2], [2|2], [1|3]$, and $[3|1]$ approximants always exhibit a positive pole prior to the occurrence of their first positive zero, precluding any identification of this first positive zero as an infrared-stable fixed point of the $\beta$- function. This result is shown to be true regardless of the magnitude of the presently-unknown five-loop $\beta$-function contribution. Moreover, the pole in question suggests the occurrence of dynamics in which both a strong and an asymptotically-free phase share a common infrared attractor. We briefly discuss the possible relevance of infrared-attractor dynamics to the success of recent calculations of the glueball mass spectra in QCD with $N_c \to \infty$ via supergravity. As $n_f$ increases above an approximant-dependent flavour threshold, Pad\'e-summation $\beta$-functions incorporating $[2|2], [1|3]$, and $[3|1]$ approximants exhibit dynamics controlled by an infrared-stable fixed point over a widening domain of the five-loop $\bar{MS}$ $\beta$-function parameter $(\beta_4/\beta_0)$. Above this threshold, all approximants considered exhibit infrared-stable fixed points that decrease in magnitude with increasing flavour number.	0	37	22
hep-ph/9905519	Odderon and photon exchange in pseudoscalar meson production	We consider exclusive $\pi^0$ production in ep-scattering. At high energies odderon and photon exchange contribute. The photon exchange contribution is evaluated exactly using data for the total virtual photon-proton absorption cross section. The odderon exchange contribution is calculated in nonperturbative QCD, using functional integral techniques and the model of the stochastic vacuum. For the proton we assume a quark-diquark structure as suggested by the small odderon amplitude in pp and $p \bar{p}$ forward scattering. We show that odderon exchange leads to a much larger inelastic than elastic $\pi^0$ production cross section. Observing our process at HERA would establish the soft odderon.	0	1	1

Using a gauge independent definition of the Abelian projection which does {\it not} employ any gauge fixing, we provide a strong evidence for the Abelian dominance in Wilson loop integral. In specific we prove that the gauge potential which contributes to the Wilson loop integral is precisely the one restricted by the Abelian projection.	0	55	39

In particular, for 2 Nf < Nc we explicitly construct the domain walls that interpolate between vacua labeled by i and (i+ N_f). We show that these solutions are Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) saturated for any value of the mass of the matter fields. This fact allows us to evaluate the large mass limit of these domain walls. We comment on the relevance of these solutions for supersymmetric gluodynamics.	0	33	33

Furthermore, the unified S-matrix approach facilitates a clean-cut study of M-theoretic R^4 curvature corrections to the low energy supergravity effective action. In particular, the leading R^4 correction to the three graviton S-matrix is computed and compared to the corresponding next to leading order two loop U(3) amplitude in Matrix Theory. We find a clear disagreement of the two resulting tensor structures.	0	19	19

This is a geometric counterpart of the well-known construction due to Shalika [17] and Piatetski-Shapiro [16]. We express the cohomology of the tensor product $_n{\cal K}_{E_1}\otimes {_n{\cal K}_{E_2}}$ in terms of cohomology of the symmetric powers of $X$. This may be considered as a geometric interpretation of the local part of the classical Rankin-Selberg method for GL(n) in the framework of the geometric Langlands program.	0	0	0

S. Bell). We also extend our investigation to the theory of algebras of unbounded observables (as developed by R. Kadison), and show how our results articulate a solid mathematical foundation for central tenets of the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory (such as the joint indeterminacy of canonically conjugate observables, and Bohr's defense of the completeness of quantum theory against the argument of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen).	0	8	7
astro-ph/9902021	Diffuse Thermal Emission from Very Hot Gas in Starburst Galaxies: Spatial Results	New BeppoSAX observations of the nearby prototypical starburst galaxies NGC 253 and M82 are presented. A companion paper (Cappi et al. 1998;astro-ph/9809325) shows that the hard (2-10 keV) spectrum of both galaxies, extracted from the source central regions, is best described by a thermal emission model with kT ~ 6-9 keV and abundances ~ 0.1-0.3 solar. The spatial analysis yields clear evidence that this emission is extended in NGC 253, and possibly also in M82. This quite clearly rules out a LLAGN as the main responsible for their hard X-ray emission. Significant contribution from point-sources (i.e. X-ray binaries (XRBs) and Supernovae Remnants (SNRs)) cannot be excluded; neither can we at present reliably estimate the level of Compton emission. However, we argue that such contributions shouldn't affect our main conclusion, i.e., that the BeppoSAX results show, altogether, compelling evidence for the existence of a very hot, metal-poor interstellar plasma in both galaxies.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9902031	Star Formation Histories from HST Color-Magnitude Diagrams of Six Fields of the LMC	We present results on the analysis of background field stars found in HST WFPC2 observations of six of the old globular clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Treated as contaminants by the globular cluster analysts, we produce V-I,V color-magnitude diagrams of the field stars and use them to explore the LMC's star formation history. The photometry approaches V~26, well below the turnoff of an ancient ~14 Gyr LMC population of stars. We use a maximum-likelihood technique to fit model CMDs drawn from Bertelli et al. (1994) isochrones to the observed CMDs. We constrain the models by the age-metallicity relation derived from LMC clusters, test four IMF slopes, and fit for the reddening, distance modulus, and star formation rate. We find that we can just resolve structure in SFR(t) with time steps of ~0.15 in log age, implying a resolution of ~4x10^8 years at an age of 1 Gyr. For a Salpeter IMF, our derived star formation history for the NGC 1754 field is characterized by an enhanced star formation rate over the past 4 Gyr, qualitatively resembling that derived by others for a variety of LMC fields. The remaining four fields, however, appear to have had high levels of star formation activity as long as 5-8 Gyr ago; these fields lie in the LMC Bar while the NGC 1754 field lies in the disk, suggesting that the inner regions of the LMC contain significantly more older stars than the outer regions. Examining the residuals of the models and observations, we find that the old red giant branches of the models provide a poor fit to the observations, which suggests an error in the model isochrones. The effect of the disagreement appears to be to underestimate the contribution of the old population.	0	71	71
astro-ph/9902054	BATSE Observations of the Piccinotti Sample of AGN	BATSE Earth occultation data have been used to search for emission in the 20-100 keV band from all sources in the Piccinotti sample, which represents to date the only complete 2-10 keV survey of the extragalactic sky down to a limiting flux of 3.1 x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2)$ s^(-1). Nearly four years of observations have been analyzed to reach a 5sigma sensitivity level of about 7.8x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) in the band considered. Of the 36 sources in the sample, 14 have been detected above 5sigma confidence level while marginal detection (3<sigma<5) can be claimed for 13 sources; for 9 objects 2sigma upper limits are reported. Comparison of BATSE results with data at higher energies is used to estimate the robustness of our data analysis: while the detection level of each source is reliable, the flux measurement maybe overestimated in some sources by as much as 35%, probably due to incomplete data cleaning. Comparison of BATSE fluxes with X-ray fluxes, obtained in the 2-10 keV range and averaged over years, indicates that a canonical power law of photon index 1.7 gives a good description of the broad band spectra of bright AGNs and that spectral breaks preferentially occur above 100 keV.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9902151	Observational Tests of the Mass-Temperature Relation for Galaxy Clusters	We examine the relationship between the mass and x-ray gas temperature of galaxy clusters using data drawn from the literature. Simple theoretical arguments suggest that the mass of a cluster is related to the x-ray temperature as $M \propto T_x^{3/2}$. Virial theorem mass estimates based on cluster galaxy velocity dispersions seem to be accurately described by this scaling with a normalization consistent with that predicted by the simulations of Evrard, Metzler, & Navarro (1996). X-ray mass estimates which employ spatially resolved temperature profiles also follow a $T_x^{3/2}$ scaling although with a normalization about 40% lower than that of the fit to the virial masses. However, the isothermal $\beta$-model and x-ray surface brightness deprojection masses follow a steeper $\propto T_x^{1.8-2.0}$ scaling. The steepness of the isothermal estimates is due to their implicitly assumed dark matter density profile of $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2}$ at large radii while observations and simulations suggest that clusters follow steeper profiles (e.g., $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2.4}$).	0	128	128

To tackle the problem, a variety of document organization algorithms and/or visualization techniques have been used to guide users in selecting relevant documents. Since these techniques require heavy computations, however, we developed a presentation server designed to serve as an intermediary between retrieval servers and clients equipped with a visualization interface. In addition, we designed our own visual interface by which users can view a set of documents from different perspectives through layers of document maps. We finally ran experiments to show that the visual interface, in conjunction with the presentation server, indeed helps users in selecting relevant documents from the retrieval results.	0	0	0

The model is solved on a finite-temperature cylinder of circumference $\beta=1/T$ with bag-inspired local boundary conditions at the two ends $x^1=0$ and $x^1=L$ which break the $\gamma_5$-invariance and thus play the role of a small quark mass. The quenched chiral condensate is found to diverge exponentially as $L\to\infty$, and to diverge (rather than melt as for $N_{\rm f}\geq1$) if the high-temperature limit $\beta\to0$ is taken at finite box-length $L$. We comment on the generalization of our results to the massive quenched theory, arguing that the condensate is finite as $L\to\infty$ and proportional to $1/m$ up to logarithms.	0	5	4

We show in particular that the validity of the Nielsen identities does not require any constraint on the gauge-fixing parameters, to the contrary of some claims found in the literature. We use the method of algebraic renormalization, which leads to results independent of the particular renormalization scheme used.	0	28	9

math-ph/9902028	Construction of Kink Sectors for Two-Dimensional Quantum Field Theory Models. An Algebraic Approach	Several two-dimensional quantum field theory models have more than one vacuum state. Familiar examples are the Sine-Gordon and the $\phi^4_2$-model. It is known that in these models there are also states, called kink states, which interpolate different vacua. A general construction scheme for kink states in the framework of algebraic quantum field theory is developed in a previous paper. However, for the application of this method, the crucial condition is the split property for wedge algebras in the vacuum representations of the considered models. It is believed that the vacuum representations of $P(\phi)_2$-models fulfill this condition, but a rigorous proof is only known for the massive free scalar field. Therefore, we investigate in a construction of kink states which can directly be applied to a large class of quantum field theory models, by making use of the properties of the dynamics of a $P(\phi)_2$ and Yukawa$_2$ models.	0	2	1

astro-ph/9911375	Chromaticity of Gravitational Microlensing Events	In this paper, we investigate the color changes of gravitational microlensing events caused by the two different mechanisms of differential amplification for a limb-darkened extended source and blending. From this investigation, we find that the color changes of limb-darkened extended source events (color curves) have dramatically different characteristics depending on whether the lens transits the source star or not. We show that for a source transit event, the lens proper motion can be determined by simply measuring the turning time of the color curve instead of fitting the overall color or light curves. We also find that even for a very small fraction of blended light, the color changes induced by the blending effect is equivalent to those caused by the limb-darkening effect, causing serious distortion in the observed color curve. Therefore, to obtain useful information about the lens and source star from the color curve of a limb-darkened extended source event, it will be essential to eliminate or correct for the blending effect. We discuss about the methods for the efficient correction of the blending effect.	0	9	9

We also estimate ICM mass using the beta model, and then evaluate iron mass contained in the ICM and derive the total gravitating mass. This gives the largest and most homogeneous information about the ICM derived only by the ASCA data. We compare these values with those of distant clusters whose temperatures, abundances, and luminosities were also measured with ASCA, and find no clear evidence of evolution for the clusters at z<1.0. Only the most distant cluster at z=1.0, AXJ2019.3+1127, has anomalously high iron abundance, but its iron mass in the ICM may be among normal values for the other clusters, because the ICM mass may be smaller than the other clusters.

Event rates are evaluated versus baseline and stored muon energy, and optimal values discussed. Over a sizeable region of oscillation parameter space, matter effects would enable the sign of \delta m^2 to be determined from a comparison of \nu_e --> \nu_\mu with \bar\nu_e --> \bar\nu_\mu event rates and energy distributions. It is important, therefore, that both positive and negative muons can be stored in the ring.

The interferometer was placed in a compact configuration which produces high brightness sensitivity, while providing discrimination against point sources. Operating at a frequency of 28.5 GHz, the FWHM primary beam of the instrument is 6.6 arcminutes. We have made sensitive images of seven fields, five of which where chosen specifically to have low IR dust contrast and be free of bright radio sources. Additional observations with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter array were used to assist in the location and removal of radio point sources. Applying a Bayesian analysis to the raw visibility data, we place limits on CMB anisotropy flat-band power Q_flat = 5.6 (+3.0 -5.6) uK and Q_flat < 14.1 uK at 68% and 95% confidence. The sensitivity of this experiment to flat band power peaks at a multipole of l = 5470, which corresponds to an angular scale of approximately 2 arcminutes. The most likely value of Q_flat is similar to the level of the expected secondary anisotropies.	0	4	4

We have performed simulations of the same volume both with and without the effects of radiative cooling, but in all cases neglect the effects of star formation and feedback.

(1993), shows an apparent scatter that is larger than expected considering the uncertainties in metallicities and ages. A number of theoretical models have been put forward to explain the large scatter. However, we present evidence, based on Edvardsson et al. (1993) data, along with Hipparcos parallaxes and new age estimates, that the scatter in the age-metallicity relation depends on the distance to the stars in the sample, such that stars within 30 pc of the Sun show significantly less scatter in [Fe/H]. Stars of intermediate age from the Edvardsson et al. sample at distances 30-80 pc from the Sun are systematically more metal-poor than those more nearby. We also find that the slope of the apparent age-metallicity relation is different for stars within 30 pc than for those stars more distant. These results are most likely an artifact of selection biases in the Edvardsson et al. star sample. We conclude that the intrinsic dispersion in metallicity at fixed age is < 0.15 dex, consistent with the < 0.1 dex scatter for Galactic open star clusters and the interstellar medium.	0	19	19

The signature of the predicted effect of geodesic mixing, i.e., of the `chaotic' behavior of photon beams in negatively curved spaces peculiar to Anosov systems with strong statistical properties, has been detected while studying the COBE-DMR 4-year data \cite{GT}. This possible observation of the negative curvature of the universe suggests the need to search for more effective ways to analyze the CMB data expected from forthcoming high precision experiments. Information theory offers such a descriptor for the CMB sky maps - the Kolmogorov complexity - as well as provides novel insight into the problem of the loss of information and time asymmetry in a hyperbolic universe.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9912121	The RASSCALS: An X-ray and Optical Study of 260 Galaxy Groups	We describe the ROSAT All-Sky Survey-Center for Astrophysics Loose Systems (RASSCALS), the largest X-ray and optical survey of low mass galaxy groups to date. We draw 260 groups from the combined Center for Astrophysics and Southern Sky Redshift Surveys, covering one quarter of the sky to a limiting Zwicky magnitude of 15.5. We detect 61 groups (23%) as extended X-ray sources. The statistical completeness of the sample allows us to make the first measurement of the X-ray selection function of groups, along with a clean determination of their fundamental scaling laws. We find robust evidence of similarity breaking in the relationship between the X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. Groups with sigma < 340 km/s are overluminous by several orders of magnitude compared to the familiar LX ~ sigma^4 law for higher velocity dispersion systems. An understanding of this break depends on the detailed structure of groups with small velocity dispersions sigma < 150 km/s.	0	1	1
astro-ph/9912168	The Magellanic Stream and the density of coronal gas in the Galactic halo	The properties of the Magellanic Stream constrain the density of coronal gas in the distant Galactic halo. We show that motion through ambient gas can strongly heat Stream clouds, driving mass loss and causing evaporation. If the ambient gas density is too high, then evaporation occurs on unreasonably short timescales. Since heating dominates drag, tidal stripping appears to be responsible for producing the Stream. Requiring the survival of the cloud MS IV for 500 Myr sets an upper limit on the halo gas density n_H< 10^{-5} cm^{-3} at 50 kpc, roughly a factor of 10 lower than that estimated from the drag model of Moore & Davis (1994). Implications for models of the evolution of gas in galaxy halos are discussed.	0	2	2
astro-ph/9912394	EXIST: A High Sensitivity Hard X-ray Imaging Sky Survey Mission for ISS	A deep all-sky imaging hard x-ray survey and wide-field monitor is needed to extend soft (ROSAT) and medium (ABRIXAS2) x-ray surveys into the 10-100 keV band (and beyond) at comparable sensitivity (~0.05 mCrab). This would enable discovery and study of >3000 obscured AGN, which probably dominate the hard x-ray background; detailed study of spectra and variability of accreting black holes and a census of BHs in the Galaxy; Gamma-ray bursts and associated massive star formation (PopIII) at very high redshift and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters throughout the Local Group; and a full galactic survey for obscured supernova remnants. The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is a proposed array of 8 x 1m^2 coded aperture telescopes fixed on the International Space Station (ISS) with 160deg x 40deg field of view which images the full sky each 90 min orbit. EXIST has been included in the most recent NASA Strategic Plan as a candidate mission for the next decade. An overview of the science goals and mission concept is presented.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9912526	Self-enrichment in Omega Centauri	The origin of abundance spreads observed in omega Centauri is studied in the context of the self-enrichment scenario. Five chemical evolution models are constructed and are compared with empirical metallicity distribution of $\omega$ Cen. After a series of simulations, it is found that neither of closed-box, outflow, nor infall models can reproduce the empirical metallicity distribution of omega Cen, while a modified outflow model with a bimodal initial mass function (IMF) gives a metallicity distribution that fits closely to the empirical ones. In the modified outflow model, long-lived stars are assumed to form after the first explosion of type II supernovae (SNII) in a proto-cloud. The modified outflow model involves gas infall at the very first chemical evolution. Thus we conclude that self-enrichment causes the abundance dispersion in omega Cen. A success of the outflow model with the bimodal IMF implies that low mass stars in a globular cluster (GC) should have formed in the gas already enriched by the first generation of SNII. This scenario, originally proposed by Cayrel (1986), can explain a lack of globular clusters with [Fe/H] > -2.2 in the Milky Way Galaxy.	0	0	0
astro-ph/9912538	Secular Instability and Planetesimal Formation in the Dust Layer	Late in the gaseous phase of a protostellar disk, centimeter-sized bodies probably settle into a thin ``dust layer'' at the midplane. A velocity difference between the dust layer and the gas gives rise to turbulence, which prevents further settling and direct gravitational instability of the layer. The associated drag on the surface of the layer causes orbital decay in a few thousand years---as opposed to a few hundred years for an isolated meter-sized body. Within this widely-accepted theoretical framework, we show that the turbulent drag causes radial instabilities even if the selfgravity of the layer is negligible. We formulate axisymmetric, height-integrated dynamical equations for the layer that incorporate turbulent diffusion of mass and momentum in radius and height, vertical settling, selfgravity, and resistance to compression due to gas entrained within the dust layer. In steady-state, the equations describe the inward radial drift of a uniform dust layer. In perturbation, overdense rings form on an orbital timescale with widths comparable to the dust-layer thickness. Selfgravity is almost irrelevant to the linear growth rate but will eventually fragment and collapse the rings into planetesimals larger than a kilometer. We estimate that the drag instability is most efficient at 1 AU when most of the ``dust'' mass lies in the size range 0.1-10 meters.	0	1	1
cond-mat/9912062	Theoretical analysis of Cooper-pair phase fluctuations in underdoped cuprates: a spin-fluctuation exchange study	We study Cooper-pair phase fluctuations in cuprate superconductors for a spin fluctuation pairing interaction. Using an electronic theory we calculate in particular for the underdoped cuprate superconductors the superfluid density $n_s(T)$, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c(x) \propto n_s$ below which phase coherent Cooper-pairs occur, and $T_c^{*}(x)$ where the phase incoherent Cooper-pairs disappear. Also we present results for the penetration depth $\lambda(x,T)$ and for the weak pseudogap temperature $T^{*}(x)$ at which a gap structure occurs in the spectral density. A Mei{\ss}ner effect is obtained only for $T < T_c$. We find that phase fluctuations become increasingly important in the underdoped regime and lead to a reduction of $T_c$ in good agreement with the experimental situation.	1	4	3
cond-mat/9912145	Stationary localized states due to nonlinear impurities described by the modified discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation	The modified discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is used to study the formation of stationary localized states in a one-dimensional lattice with a single impurity and an asymmetric dimer impurity. A periodically modulated and a perfectly nonlinear chain is also considered. Phase diagrams of localized states for all systems are presented. From the mean square displacement calculation, it is found that all states are not localized even though the system comprises random nonlinear site energies. Stability of the states is discussed.	1	0	0

cond-mat/9912217	Time-Dependent Variational Analysis of Josephson Oscillations in a Two-component Bose-Einstein Condensate	The dynamics of Josephson-like oscillations between two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates is studied using the time-dependent variational method. We suppose that the quantum state of the condensates is a gaussian wave-packet which can translate and perform breathing shape oscillations. Under this hypotheses we study the influence of these degrees of freedom on the tunneling dynamics by comparing the full-model with one where these degrees of freedom are ``frozen'' at its equilibrium values. The result of our calculation shows that when the traps are not displaced the two models agree, whereas when they are, the models differ considerably, the former being now closer to its linear approximation.	1	0	0

We investigate characteristics of this jamming and examine similarities and differences between our results and those with random sequential update.	1	0	0
hep-ph/9912247	Imaginative Cosmology	We review a few off-the-beaten-track ideas in cosmology. They solve a variety of fundamental problems; also they are fun. We start with a description of non-singular dilaton cosmology. In these scenarios gravity is modified so that the Universe does not have a singular birth. We then present a variety of ideas mixing string theory and cosmology. These solve the cosmological problems usually solved by inflation, and furthermore shed light upon the issue of the number of dimensions of our Universe. We finally review several aspects of the varying speed of light theory. We show how the horizon, flatness, and cosmological constant problems may be solved in this scenario. We finally present a possible experimental test for a realization of this theory: a test in which the Supernovae results are to be combined with recent evidence for redshift dependence in the fine structure constant.	0	15	2
hep-ph/9912265	Yukawa Hierarchies from Split Fermions in Extra Dimensions	We explore a mechanism for generating the Yukawa hierarchies by displacing the left- and right-handed components of the Standard Model fermions in a higher-dimensional space. We find a unique configuration of displacements which fits all quark and lepton masses and mixing angles, with a prediction for the strange quark mass m_s = 120 MeV.	0	157	132
hep-ph/9912413	About R-parity and the Supersymmetric Standard Model	We recall the obstacles which seemed, long ago, to prevent one from viewing supersymmetry as a possible fundamental symmetry of Nature. Is spontaneous supersymmetry breaking possible ? Where is the spin-1/2 Goldstone fermion of supersymmetry, if not a neutrino ? Which bosons and fermions could be related ? Can one define conserved baryon and lepton numbers in such theories, although they systematically involve self-conjugate Majorana fermions ? If we have to postulate the existence of new bosons carrying B and L (the new spin-0 squarks and sleptons), can we prevent them from mediating new unwanted interactions ? We then recall how we obtained the three basic ingredients of the Supersymmetric Standard Model: 1) the SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) gauge superfields; 2) the chiral quark and lepton superfields; 3) the two doublet Higgs superfields responsible for the electroweak breaking, and the generation of quark and lepton masses. The original continuous ``R-invariance'' of this model was soon abandoned in favor of its discrete version, R-parity, so that the gravitino, and gluinos, can acquire masses - gluinos getting their masses from supergravity, or radiative corrections. R-parity forbids unwanted squark and slepton exchanges, and guarantees the stability of the ``lightest supersymmetric particle''. It is present only since we restricted the initial superpotential to be an even function of quark and lepton superfields (so as to allow for B and L conservation laws), as made apparent by the formula re-expressing R-parity as (-1)^2S (-1)^(3B+L). Whether it turns out to be absolutely conserved, or not, R-parity plays an essential role in the phenomenology of supersymmetric theories, and the experimental searches for the new sparticles.	0	3	2
hep-ph/9912511	Spontaneous CP violation model with flavor symmetry in large extra dimensions	We construct the minimal SUSY model that causes spontaneous CP violation with an abelian flavor symmetry in the context of the large extra dimensions and show that various phenomenological problems can be solved by introducing only scales below the low fundamental scale. We also realize the realistic size of the CP violation and the small masses of the neutrinos. The strong CP problem can be solved by the axion scenario and the axion can be made invisible by introducing an additional large extra dimension.	0	7	7

The Cherenkov power spectrum is determined also for the two-charge system. It is argued that the massive Cherenkov effect can be observed in superconductive media, ionosphere plasma, waveguides and in particle laboratories.	0	0	0
hep-th/9912067	A Hiker's Guide to K3 - Aspects of N=(4,4) Superconformal Field Theory with central charge c=6	We study the moduli space ${\cal M}$ of N=(4,4) superconformal field theories with central charge c=6. After a slight emendation of its global description we find the locations of various known models in the component of ${\cal M}$ associated to K3 surfaces. Among them are the Z_2 and Z_4 orbifold theories obtained from the torus component of ${\cal M}$. Here, SO(4,4) triality is found to play a dominant role. We obtain the B-field values in direction of the exceptional divisors which arise from orbifolding. We prove T-duality for the Z_2 orbifolds and use it to derive the form of ${\cal M}$ purely within conformal field theory. For the Gepner model (2)^4 and some of its orbifolds we find the locations in ${\cal M}$ and prove isomorphisms to nonlinear sigma models. In particular we prove that the Gepner model (2)^4 has a geometric interpretation with Fermat quartic target space.	0	64	58
hep-th/9912193	Large hierarchy from extra dimensions	We argue that the familiar gauge hierarchy between the fundamental Planck scale M_{Pl} and the electroweak scale M_{W}, can be naturally explained in higher dimensional theories with relatively large radii (R_c > 1/M_{Pl}) extra dimensions. In particular, we show that it is possible that the electroweak Higgs mass at high energies is of the order of M_{Pl}, but radiative corrections drive it to an infrared stable fixed-point $\sim M_{W}$ at low energies thus inducing a large hierarchy without any fine tuning of parameters.	0	15	6
hep-th/9912279	Self-Duality, Ramond-Ramond Fields, and K-Theory	Just as D-brane charge of Type IIA and Type IIB superstrings is classified, respectively, by K^1(X) and K(X), Ramond-Ramond fields in these theories are classified, respectively, by K(X) and K^1(X). By analyzing a recent proposal for how to interpret quantum self-duality of RR fields, we show that the Dirac quantization formula for the RR p-forms, when properly formulated, receives corrections that reflect curvature, lower brane charges, and an anomaly of D-brane world-volume fermions. The K-theory framework is important here, because the term involving the fermion anomaly cannot be naturally expressed in terms of cohomology and differential forms.	0	152	141
hep-th/9912286	Exact Renormalized One-Loop Quantum Corrections to Energies of Solitonic Field Configurations	We develop a method for computing exact one-loop quantum corrections to the energies of static classical backgrounds in renormalizable quantum field theories. We use a continuum density of states formalism to construct a regularized Casimir energy in terms of phase shifts and their Born approximations. This method unambiguously incorporates definite counterterms fixed in the standard way by physical renormalization conditions. The result is a robust computation that can be efficiently implemented both numerically and analytically. We carry out such calculations in models of bosons and fermions in one and three dimensions.	0	1	1

The case of Hall-Littlewood polynomials is particularly interesting; the elements of the diagram are partitions, the branching multiplicities are integers, the combinatorial dimensions are Green's polynomials, and the Jordan form of a randomly chosen unipotent upper triangular matrix over a finite field gives rise to a harmonic function. The case of Schur functions yields natural deformations of the Young lattice and Plancharel measure. Many harmonic functions are constructed and algorithms for sampling from the underlying probability measures are given.	0	1	0

An analysis was performed to kinematically isolate Delta knockout events from conventional Delta photoproduction events, and a statistically significant excess of pi+p events was identified, consistent with Delta++ knockout. Two methods were used to estimate the DeltaNN probability in the 3He ground state, corresponding to the observed knockout cross section. The first gave a lower probability limit of 1.5+/-0.6+/-0.5%; the second yielded an upper limit of about 2.6%.	0	2	1
